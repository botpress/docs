Welcome to the Botpress tutorial! This will teach you the basics of building, testing, and deploying AI agents using Botpress Studio.

## What is Botpress?

Botpress is an all-in-one platform for building AI agents powered by the latest LLMs.

Unlike other platforms for building AI agents, *Botpress handles every step of the bot development process*, from building to deployment. You don't need to host anything yourself or worry about managing infrastructure—everything runs securely and seamlessly in the cloud.

{/* ## Who is this tutorial for?

This tutorial is for you if:

- You followed the [quickstart guide](/learn/get-started/quick-start) and want to fine-tune your bot
- You followed the [quickstart guide](/learn/get-started/quick-start) and skipped the setup process
- You're already a Botpress user and want to learn more */}

## Who is this tutorial for?

If you pressed **Skip** during the [Quickstart guide](/learn/get-started/quick-start), this tutorial is for you.

When you first log in to Botpress, we offer to quickly spin up an AI agent using information about your business. However, we understand that some bot builders want to get creative right away. If that's you, keep reading!

## How should I use this tutorial?

We recommend going from start to finish.

Each section presents an exercise that teaches you about a feature. **Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones**, so following them in order ensures that you never miss anything.

These exercises won't teach you everything there is to know about every single feature—that's not helpful for learning. Instead, you'll learn what's necessary to accomplish the current exercise.

<GoodToKnow>
  Any optional (but good to know) information will go in a callout like this one.

  If you get curious about a feature after finishing an exercise, you can check out our documentation on [Studio concepts](/learn/reference/introduction) to keep reading.

## Do I need to know how to code?

No.

In Botpress, you can use as little or as much code as you need, *including no code at all*. While code can help you customize your bot's behaviour in powerful ways, it's entirely possible to build a powerful AI agent without it.

<Note>
Later in the tutorial, you may encounter features that are necessarily code-based. In this case, we'll let you know at the top of the page.
