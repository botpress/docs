Welcome to Botpress! This tutorial will teach you the basics of building, testing, and deploying AI agents using Botpress Studio.

## What is Botpress?

Botpress is an all-in-one platform for building AI agents powered by the latest LLMs.

Unlike other platforms for building AI agents, *Botpress handles every step of the bot development process*, from building to deployment. You don't need to host anything yourself or worry about managing infrastructure—everything runs securely and seamlessly in the cloud.

{/* ## Who is this tutorial for?

This tutorial is for you if:

- You followed the [quickstart guide](/learn/get-started/quick-start) and want to fine-tune your bot
- You followed the [quickstart guide](/learn/get-started/quick-start) and skipped the setup process
- You're already a Botpress user and want to learn more */}

## Who is this tutorial for?

Anyone who wants

## How should I use this tutorial?

We recommend going from start to finish.

Each section presents an exercise that teaches you about a feature. **Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones**, so following them in order ensures that you never miss anything.

These exercises won't teach you everything there is to know about every single feature—that's not helpful for learning. Instead, you'll learn what's necessary to accomplish the current exercise.

<Tip>
  If you get curious about a feature after finishing an exercise, you can check out our documentation on [Studio concepts](/learn/reference/introduction) to keep reading.
</Tip>

## Do I need to know how to code?

No.

In Botpress, you can use as little or as much code as you need, *including no code at all*. While code can help you customize your bot's behaviour in powerful ways, it's entirely possible to build a powerful AI agent without it.

<Note>
Later in the tutorial, you may encounter features that are necessarily code-based. In this case, we'll let you know at the top of the page.

{/* ### Configure your bot's behaviour

Let's add some custom behaviour to your bot.

In Botpress, you configure your bot's behaviour using Workflows. A Workflow is a drag-and-drop canvas that represents the steps your bot follows during a conversation with a user.

Each step in a Workflow is represented by a Node. Let's open the **Main** Workflow and take a look at its Nodes:

1. In Studio, select Workflow from the left navigation bar.
2. Select your **Main** Workflow. It should look something like this:

<img src="./assets/studio-workflow.png" />

The **Main** Workflow contains the main logic for your bot—it executes as soon as a user starts a new conversation. By default, the **Main** Workflow contains:

* A `Start Node`
* An `Autonomous Node`
* An `End Node`

Notice the path connecting the Start Node and the Autonomous Node:

<img src="./assets/autonomous-node.png" />

This is a transition. When someone starts a conversation with your bot, it first executes the Start Node, then transitions to the Autonomous Node.

<Tip>
Drag Nodes

You can drag a Node to move it anywhere in your Workflow. Just select and hold the Node, then drag and release wherever you want to move it.

Moving a Node doesn't affect your bot's behavior—it just helps keep your Workflow organized.
</Tip>

#### Display a custom greeting

Let's create a new Node to add a custom greeting to your bot.

First, we need to create a new `Standard Node`:

1. Select and hold the **right edge** of the Start Node.
2. Drag outwards to create a new transition.
3. Release anywhere on the canvas. You'll see a list of Node types to choose from—select **Standard Node**.

You just created a new Node! Notice that because you dragged out from the edge of the Start Node, it automatically transitioned to the new Node:

<img src="./assets/start-node.png" />

Next, let's add the greeting. To do this, we need to add a `Card` to the new Node:

1. In the new Node, select **Add Card**. This opens the Cards menu.
2. Select the **Text** Card.
3. In the **Message to send** field, enter a custom greeting. For this guide, we'll enter "Hello! I'm Teddy, the helpful bot!":

<img align="center" src="./assets/send-message-card.png" />

Now your bot has a custom greeting! Before wrapping up, let's connect the new Node to the Autonomous Node:

1. Select and hold the **right edge** of the new Node.
2. Drag outwards to create a new transition.
3. Release on the **left edge** of the Autonomous Node.

This creates a transition from the new Node to the Autonomous Node, so your bot continues the conversation after displaying the greeting:

<img src="./assets/transition-between-nodes.png" />

#### Add custom instructions

Now that your bot has a greeting, let's add some custom instructions for when it's interacting with a user. From the Autonomous Node, open the **Instructions** section.

By default, this field contains a detailed list of natural language instructions for your bot. You can modify these, or start from scratch with your own instructions.

For now, let's just tell your bot its name and give it a simple task. Erase everything in the **Instructions** section, and enter "Ask the user if they have any questions about dogs, then assist them".

<img src="./assets/add-custom-instruction.png" />

## Step 2: Test your bot

Congratulations! You now have a bot with a custom greeting and instructions. Next, let's test it out to make sure it's working properly. */}
