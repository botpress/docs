Every variable has a *scope* that determines where and when your bot can access it. The variable we created in the previous lesson is a *Workflow* variable—meaning it's scoped the current Workflow.

To get a better sense of what that means, try restarting the conversation. Select **<Icon icon="rotate-ccw"/>** in the Emulator, then send a message:

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="New conversation"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="./assets/new-conversation.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="New conversation"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="./assets/new-conversation-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

That's not ideal—the bot asked for our name again, even though we already told it in a previous conversation. This is because `firstName` is a *Workflow* variable—it only keeps the same value for the current Workflow.
