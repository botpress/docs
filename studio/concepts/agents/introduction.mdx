- [Enforcing policies](/studio/concepts/agents/policy-agent) across your bot's interactions
- Allowing your bot to [communicate in multiple languages](/studio/concepts/agents/translator-agent)
- Providing [summaries and transcripts](/studio/concepts/agents/summary-agent) of your bot's conversations
