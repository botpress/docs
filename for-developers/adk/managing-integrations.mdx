title: Managing integrations
---

Integrations connect your agent to external services and platforms. This guide covers how to add, configure, and manage integrations in your ADK project.

## Adding integrations

### Using the CLI

Add an integration using the `adk add` command:

```bash
adk add webchat
adk add slack@latest
adk add my-workspace/custom-integration@1.0.0
```

This automatically:
- Adds the integration to `agent.config.ts`
- Generates TypeScript types for the integration

### Manual configuration

You can also manually edit `agent.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config ...
  dependencies: {
    integrations: {
      webchat: {
        version: "webchat@latest",
        enabled: true,
      },
      slack: {
        version: "slack@0.5.0",
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

After editing manually, run `adk dev` or `adk build` to regenerate types.

## Integration versions

Integration versions use the format `name@version`:

- `webchat@latest` - Use the latest version
- `slack@0.5.0` - Use a specific version
- `my-workspace/custom@1.2.3` - Use an integration from a specific workspace

<Tip>
Use `@latest` when you want to automatically receive updates. Use specific versions for production deployments to ensure stability.
</Tip>

## Enabling and disabling

Control which integrations are active:

```typescript
dependencies: {
  integrations: {
    webchat: {
      version: "webchat@latest",
      enabled: true,
    },
    slack: {
      version: "slack@latest",
      enabled: false,
    },
  },
}
```

Disabled integrations are still included in your project but won't be active when your agent runs.

## Integration configuration

If you install an integration that requires configuration, you'll receive a message instructing you to configure it:

```bash
adk add instagram
```

```text
✓ Added instagram version x.x.x to agent.config.ts

Please configure it in the UI using the adk dev command to start using it.
```

## Updating integrations

To update an integration:

### Using the CLI

```
adk update <integration-name>
```

### Manually

You can also update the version it manually:

1. Update the version in `agent.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   dependencies: {
     integrations: {
       webchat: {
         version: "webchat@0.3.0",
         enabled: true,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

2. Run `adk dev` or `adk build` to regenerate types

3. Test your agent to ensure compatibility

## Removing integrations

Remove an integration by deleting it from `agent.config.ts`:

```typescript
dependencies: {
  integrations: {
    webchat: {
      version: "webchat@latest",
      enabled: true,
    },
    // Removed slack integration
  },
}
```

Run `adk dev` or `adk build` to update generated types.

<Tip>
Always test your agent after adding, updating, or removing integrations to ensure everything works correctly.
