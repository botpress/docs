title: Managing integrations
---

Integrations connect your agent to external services and platforms. This guide covers how to add, configure, and manage integrations in your ADK project.

## Adding integrations

### Using the CLI

Add an integration using the `adk add` command:

```bash
adk add webchat
adk add slack@latest
adk add my-workspace/custom-integration@1.0.0
```

This automatically:
- Adds the integration to `dependencies.json`
- Generates TypeScript types for the integration
- Enables the integration by default

### Manual configuration

You can also manually edit `dependencies.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "webchat": {
      "version": "webchat@latest",
      "enabled": true
    },
    "slack": {
      "version": "slack@0.5.0",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

After editing manually, run `adk dev` or `adk build` to regenerate types.

## Integration versions

Integration versions use the format `name@version`:

- `webchat@latest` - Use the latest version
- `slack@0.5.0` - Use a specific version
- `my-workspace/custom@1.2.3` - Use an integration from a specific workspace

<Tip>
Use `@latest` for integrations you want to automatically receive updates for. Use specific versions for production deployments to ensure stability.
</Tip>

## Enabling and disabling

Control which integrations are active:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "webchat": {
      "version": "webchat@latest",
      "enabled": true
    },
    "slack": {
      "version": "slack@latest",
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Disabled integrations are still included in your project but won't be active when your agent runs.

## Using integration types

Once an integration is added, TypeScript types are automatically generated. Use them in your code:

```typescript
import { WebchatIntegration } from "@botpress/runtime";

export default new Conversation({
  channel: "webchat",
  handler: async ({ execute, message }) => {
    // Type-safe access to webchat-specific features
    await execute({
      instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    });
  },
});
```

## Integration configuration

Some integrations require configuration. Configure them in Botpress Studio or through the Botpress API after deployment.

For local development, you can provide configuration through environment variables or the Botpress CLI.

## Updating integrations

To update an integration:

1. Update the version in `dependencies.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "integrations": {
       "webchat": {
         "version": "webchat@0.3.0"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Run `adk dev` or `adk build` to regenerate types

3. Test your agent to ensure compatibility

## Removing integrations

Remove an integration by deleting it from `dependencies.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "webchat": {
      "version": "webchat@latest",
      "enabled": true
    }
    // Removed slack integration
  }
}
```

Run `adk dev` or `adk build` to update generated types.

<Tip>
Always test your agent after adding, updating, or removing integrations to ensure everything works correctly.
