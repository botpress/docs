This guide walks you through installing the ADK and creating your first agent project.

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [Botpress account](https://sso.botpress.cloud)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v22.0.0 or higher)
  - A supported package manager — [bun](https://bun.sh), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
</Info>

## Installation

Install the ADK CLI globally:

<CodeGroup>

```bash macOS & Linux
curl -fsSL https://github.com/botpress/adk/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/botpress/adk/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex"
```

</CodeGroup>

Verify the installation:

```bash
adk --version
```

## Create your first agent

Initialize a new agent project:

```bash
adk init my-agent
```

```txt
 ▄▀█ █▀▄ █▄▀  Botpress ADK
 █▀█ █▄▀ █░█  Initialize New Agent


Select a template:

› Blank
    Start with an empty agent project

  Hello World
    Start with a conversation agent project
```

Select the `Hello World` template, then follow the prompts to set up the agent. This creates a new `my-agent` directory with:

- `agent.config.ts` - Agent configuration and integration dependencies
- `agent.json` - Configuration for your linked bot
- `package.json` - Project configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `src/` - Source code directory structure

## Install dependencies

Once you've finished the setup, navigate into your project:

```bash
cd my-agent
```

Install the dependencies:

<CodeGroup>

```bash bun
bun install
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```

```bash npm
npm install
```

</CodeGroup>

## Test your agent

Now, you're ready to test your agent.

### Start the development server

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
adk dev
```

This command:

1. Generates TypeScript types for your integrations
2. Builds your agent
3. Starts a local development server
4. Watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds

### Chat in the terminal

Open a new terminal window and start a conversation with your agent:

```bash
adk chat
```

```txt
Botpress Chat
Type "exit" or press ESC key to quit
👤 Hey!
🤖 Hello! How can I assist you today?
>>
```

### View the ADK console

Visit [`http://localhost:3001/`](http://localhost:3001/) to access the interactive ADK console. This gives you an intuitive, visual breakdown of your agent project and lets you [configure its integration's settings](/for-developers/adk/managing-integrations#integration-configuration).

## Build your agent

Compile your agent for production:

```bash
adk build
```

```txt
📦 Loaded project: my-agent
📝 Generating assets types...
✅ Assets types generated
🔨 Generating Botpress bot project...
✅ Bot project generated
🏗️  Building agent...

✅ Build completed successfully!
📦 Output directory: <project-path>/.adk/bot/.botpress/dist
```

This creates an optimized build in the `.adk/bot/.botpress/dist` directory.

## Deploy your agent

When you're ready, you can deploy your agent to Botpress Cloud:

```bash
adk deploy
```

```txt
📤 Deploying bot to Botpress...

✅ Agent deployed successfully!
🌐 Your agent is now live on Botpress
🤖 Bot ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
🏢 Workspace ID: wkspace_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This uploads your agent to your Botpress workspace and makes it available for use.
