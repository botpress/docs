The **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is a CLI tool and development framework for building AI agents on Botpress. It provides a streamlined development experience with TypeScript support, hot reloading, and type-safe APIs for creating conversational AI applications.

<Tip>
  The [Botpress documentation assistant](#ask) is built entirely using the ADK and the [Webchat React library](/webchat/react-library/get-started). You can [check out the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/botpress/docs-bot).

## What is the ADK?

The ADK allows developers to build Botpress agents using code instead of the Studio interface. It provides:

- **Project scaffolding**: Quickly initialize new agent projects with templates
- **Type-safe development**: Automatic TypeScript type generation for integrations, interfaces, and more
- **Development workflow**: Hot reloading development server with live updates
- **Build and deploy**: Compile and deploy agents to Botpress Cloud
- **Integration management**: Add, update, and manage integrations from the Botpress Hub

## When to use the ADK

The ADK is ideal for:

- Developers who prefer code-based workflows
- Teams using version control and CI/CD pipelines
- Projects requiring custom logic and integrations
- Developers who need TypeScript type safety

<Tip>
For most users, we recommend Botpress Studio. The ADK is best suited for developers who need more control or integration with development workflows.
