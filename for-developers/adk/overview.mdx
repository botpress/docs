The **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is a CLI tool and development framework for building AI agents on Botpress. It provides a streamlined development experience with TypeScript support, hot reloading, and type-safe APIs for creating conversational AI applications.

## What is the ADK?

The ADK enables developers to build Botpress agents using code instead of the Studio interface. It provides:

- **Project scaffolding**: Quickly initialize new agent projects with templates
- **Type-safe development**: Automatic TypeScript type generation for integrations, interfaces, and more
- **Development workflow**: Hot reloading development server with live updates
- **Build and deploy**: Compile and deploy agents to Botpress Cloud
- **Integration management**: Add, update, and manage integrations from the Botpress Hub

## Key features

### TypeScript-first development

The ADK generates TypeScript types for all integrations, interfaces, and assets in your project, providing full IntelliSense support and compile-time type checking.

### Project structure

ADK projects follow a clear, organized structure:

- `src/conversations/` - Conversation handlers for different channels
- `src/workflows/` - Long-running processes and background tasks
- `src/actions/` - Callable functions that can be invoked by workflows or conversations
- `src/tables/` - Data storage schemas and table definitions
- `src/triggers/` - Event subscriptions and handlers
- `src/knowledge/` - Knowledge base sources and files

### Development workflow

The ADK provides a seamless development experience:

1. **Initialize**: Create a new agent project with `adk init`
2. **Develop**: Run `adk dev` for hot reloading development
3. **Build**: Compile your agent with `adk build`
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to Botpress Cloud with `adk deploy`

## When to use the ADK

The ADK is ideal for:

- Developers who prefer code-based workflows
- Teams using version control and CI/CD pipelines
- Projects requiring custom logic and integrations
- Developers who need TypeScript type safety

<Tip>
For most users, the Botpress Studio web interface is recommended. The ADK is best suited for experienced developers who need more control or integration with development workflows.
