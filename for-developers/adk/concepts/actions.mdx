Actions are callable functions that can be invoked by workflows, conversations, or other actions. They encapsulate reusable logic and can be called from anywhere in your agent.

## Creating an action

Create an action in `src/actions/`:

```typescript
import { Action, z } from "@botpress/runtime";

export default new Action({
  name: "myAction",
  input: z.object({}), // Input schema
  output: z.object({}), // Output schema
  handler: async ({}) => {
    // Function logic
    return {}
  },
});
```

## Action input and output

Define input and output schemas using TypeScript types or Zod schemas:

```typescript highlight={3-11}
export default new Action({
  name: "calculateTotal",
  input: z.object({
    items: z.array(z.object({
      price: z.number(),
      quantity: z.number(),
    })),
  }),
  output: z.object({
    total: z.number()
  }),
  handler: async (input) => {
    const total = input.items.reduce(
      (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
      0
    );
    return { total };
  },
});
```

## Calling actions

Actions can be called from anywhere in your agent's source. Just import `actions` and call them directly:

<CodeGroup>

```ts From a workflow highlight={1, 6}
import { Workflow, actions } from "@botpress/runtime";

export default new Workflow({
  name: "someWorkflow",
  handler: async ({}) => {
    const result = await actions.doSomething();
      // Other logic
  },
});
```

```ts From a trigger highlight={1, 9}
import { Trigger, actions } from "@botpress/runtime";

export default new Trigger({
  name: "webchatConversationStarted",
  events: [
    "webchat:conversationStarted",
  ],
  handler: async ({ event }) => {
    const result = await actions.doSomething()
    // Other logic
  },
});
```

```ts From a tool highlight={1,6}
import { Autonomous, actions } from "@botpress/runtime"

export default new Autonomous.Tool({
    name: "someTool",
    handler: async () => {
        const result = await actions.doSomething()
    }
    // Other logic
})
```

</CodeGroup>

### As a tool in a conversation

You can provide an action to your agent as a [tool](/for-developers/adk/concepts/tools) using the `asTool` method:

```ts highlight={1,8}
import { Conversation, actions } from "@botpress/runtime";

export default new Conversation({
  channel: "*",
  handler: async ({ execute }) => {
    await execute({
      instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
      tools: [actions.calculateTotal.asTool()]
    });
  },
});
```

## Integration actions

When you [install an integration](/for-developers/adk/managing-integrations), its actions become available anywhere in your agent's source:

```ts highlight={1, 12-14}
import { Trigger, actions } from "@botpress/runtime";

export default new Trigger({
  name: "webchatConversationStarted",
  events: [
    "webchat:conversationStarted",
  ],
  handler: async ({ event }) => {
    let conversationId = event.conversationId

    if (conversationId) {
      await actions.webchat.showWebchat({
        conversationId
      })
    }

  },
});
```

## Best practices

- Keep actions focused on a single responsibility
- Use actions for reusable logic that's needed across multiple parts of your agent

<Tip>
Actions are ideal for business logic that doesn't need to be part of the conversational flow. They can be tested independently and reused across different parts of your agent.
