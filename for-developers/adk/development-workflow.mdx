title: Development workflow
---

This guide covers the typical development workflow when building agents with the ADK, from initial setup to deployment.

## Development cycle

### 1. Initialize a project

Create a new agent project:

```bash
adk init my-agent
cd my-agent
```

Choose a template:
- `blank` - Empty project with basic structure
- `hello-world` - Example project with webchat integration

### 2. Start development server

Run the development server:

```bash
adk dev
```

This command:
- Authenticates with Botpress Cloud (if needed)
- Generates TypeScript types for integrations
- Builds your agent
- Starts a local development server
- Watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically

The development server provides:
- **Hot reloading** - Changes to your code automatically rebuild
- **Type generation** - Integration types are regenerated when dependencies change
- **Error reporting** - Build errors are displayed in the terminal

### 3. Develop your agent

Edit your agent code in the `src/` directory:

```
src/
├── conversations/  # Edit conversation handlers
├── workflows/      # Edit workflows
├── actions/        # Edit actions
├── tables/         # Edit table schemas
├── triggers/       # Edit triggers
└── knowledge/     # Edit knowledge sources
```

Changes are automatically detected and rebuilt.

### 4. Test locally

Test your agent using:
- The development server's web interface
- Integration-specific testing tools
- The `adk chat` command for deployed bots

### 5. Build for production

Build your agent:

```bash
adk build
```

This creates an optimized build in `.botpress/dist/` ready for deployment.

### 6. Deploy

Deploy to Botpress Cloud:

```bash
adk deploy
```

Or deploy to a specific bot:

```bash
adk deploy --bot-id my-bot-id
```

## File watching

The development server watches for changes to:
- Source files in `src/`
- `agent.config.ts`
- `dependencies.json`
- `package.json`

When changes are detected:
1. TypeScript types are regenerated (if dependencies changed)
2. The agent is rebuilt
3. The development server is restarted

## Debugging

### Source maps

Source maps are enabled by default in development. They help debug TypeScript code by mapping compiled code back to source files.

### Logging

Use the logger in your handlers:

```typescript
export default new Conversation({
  channel: "*",
  handler: async ({ execute, context }) => {
    context.logger.info("Processing message");
    // ...
  },
});
```

### Type checking

TypeScript provides compile-time type checking. Fix type errors before deploying:

```bash
# Check types without building
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Best practices

### Version control

Commit these files to version control:
- `src/` - Your source code
- `agent.config.ts` - Agent configuration
- `dependencies.json` - Integration dependencies
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

Don't commit:
- `.botpress/` - Generated files (add to `.gitignore`)
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (add to `.gitignore`)

### Organizing code

- Keep conversations focused on specific channels or use cases
- Extract reusable logic into actions
- Use workflows for long-running or scheduled tasks
- Group related files in subdirectories when needed

### Testing

Test your agent:
- During development with the dev server
- Before deploying with `adk build`
- After deployment with `adk chat` or integration testing tools

<Tip>
Keep your development server running while coding. The hot reload feature makes iteration fast and feedback immediate.
