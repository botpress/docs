<Note>
    Using your own LLM is available on [Enterprise plans](https://botpress.com/pricing). To get started with your own LLM, [contact our sales team](https://botpress.com/contact-us?ref=navbar).

You can use the Botpress SDK to **integrate your own LLM**, giving you full control over the intelligence powering your AI agents.

Bringing your own LLM can unlock greater flexibility and performance for your bot. You can:

- Fine-tune your model for your industry
- Align the model's tone and behaviour with your brand
- Scale cost-effectively and extend your existing AI infrastructure
