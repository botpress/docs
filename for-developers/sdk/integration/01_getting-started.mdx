## 1. Log in to Botpress
To get started, first log in to your Botpress account using the Botpress CLI. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

<Note>All the following examples use `npm`, but feel free to use the package manager of your choice like `yarn` or `pnpm`.</Note>

```bash
npx @botpress/cli login
```

{/* TODO: add a guide on how to create a personal access token and link to it. */}
This command will prompt you for your a personal access token. You can create a new token by going to [the dashboard](https://app.botpress.cloud) and navigating to the Personal Access Tokens page.

## 2. Initialize a New Integration
Next, create a new integration using the Botpress CLI. This will set up a new directory with the necessary files and structure for your integration. 

```bash
npx @botpress/cli init --type "integration" --name "my-integration" --template "hello-world"
```

{/* TODO: add a guide on a how to claim a workspace handle and link to it. */}
The CLI will prompt you for some information including your workspace and / or your workspace handle. If you don't have a workspace handle yet, the CLI should claim it for you. You can also claim one yourself by going to [the dashboard](https://app.botpress.cloud) and navigating to the Settings page.

## 2. Install Dependencies and Build
Once the integration is initialized, navigate to the integration directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ./my-integration
npm i && npx @botpress/cli build
```

## 3. Browse the Integration Files

You can now open the integration in vscode or another code editor of your choice.

```bash
code .
```

Here's a brief overview of the files and folders you'll find in the integration directory:

- `integrations.definition.ts`: This file contains the integration definition. It exports a datastructure that describes what is your integration, what it can do and how it can be used. This includes the integration's name and version, but also actions, events, channels, and other capabilities. The template you chose only declares a single action `helloWorld` that accepts an optional name parameter and returns a greeting message. Keep reading this documentation to learn about all the possible concepts you can declare in this file.

- `src/index.ts`: This file contains the integration's implementation. It exports a datastructure that implements what was defined in the integration definition. Keep reading this documentation to learn about all the callbacks you can implement in this file.

- `.botpress/`: This folder contains the integration's output. It is generated by the build command. It exports typings that you can use when implementing your integration and bundled javascript that is used to execute your integration. You can take a look at what's inside, but be carefull not to import things from nested files or folders as its structure is subject to change. Everything that is meant to be exported is available from the root of the folder.

- `icon.svg`, `hub.md`: These files contain the integration's icon and readme. They are referenced in the integration definition.

- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`: Just like for any other Node.js TypeScript project, these files contain respectively the metadata and dependencies of your package and the TypeScript configuration. The `tsconfig.json` file is preconfigured offer the best possible experience for the Botpress SDK. Run `npm run check:type` to check for typing errors.

## 4. Update the code to remove errors

The template you chose ships with unimplemented register callbacks. In `src/index.ts`, you should see a `register` and `unregister` functions with a body that looks like this:

```ts
throw new sdk.RuntimeError('Invalid configuration')
```

Remove these error statements for now. You can comeback later to implement your own validation logic.

## 5. Deploy the integration

Once you have made the necessary changes to your integration, you can deploy it to Botpress Cloud. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx @botpress/cli deploy
```

You should be prompted for a couple information and confirmations. This integration will be deployed privately to your workspace. It is only visible and usable by members of your workspace. As long as it remains private, you can update the same version by running the deploy command shown above. You can also deploy a new version, by updating the integration's definition and running the deploy command again.

Once deployed, go to [the dashboard](https://app.botpress.cloud) and navigate to the Your Integrations page. You should see your integration listed there.

## 6. Try out your integration in the Botpress Studio

{/* TODO: add a guide on how to install an integration in the studio and link to it. */}
It is now time to test your integration. To do this, either create a new bot or open an existing one in the Botpress Studio. Navigate to the hub and install your integration. Create a basic flow and use the `helloWorld` card. It will return a greeting message.
