Integrations form the foundation of connectivity within the Botpress platform, enabling bots to interact with external services and systems. Through the Botpress SDK, developers can create custom integrations that connect bots to virtually any third-party service, from messaging platforms to data repositories and enterprise systems.

The Botpress Studio already allows installing publicly available integrations to your bot. To create your own integration, you can read the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide.
