## Package Types in Botpress SDK

The Botpress SDK supports three types of packages:

* **Integration Packages**
* **Interface Packages**
* **Plugin Packages** (Coming Soon)

## Installing Packages

### Basic Installation Syntax

```bash
npx bp add [--package-type <type>] <package-name>[@version]
```

The `--package-type` argument is optional but necessary when resolving name collisions between an integration, an interface, or a plugin. For example, there is an actual interface, integration, and plugin named `hitl`. In such cases, specifying the package type ensures the correct one is used. **When in doubt, always include the`--package-type` argument.**

### Installing Interface Packages

Installing interface packages is useful for integration development. It allows an integration developer to implement an interface. Check out [this page](https://botpress.com/docs/llm-interfaces) to learn how to use an interface package.

```bash
# Install LLM interface with latest version
npx bp add llm
# Install HITL interface version 0.0.1
npx bp add --package-type interface hitl@0.0.1
# Install an interface using its ID
npx bp add b759e577-2ce7-451a-abff-68085b224985
```

### Installing Integration Packages

Installing integration packages is mostly useful for *as-code* bot development (using the SDK). It serves no purpose for bots developed in the studio.

```bash
# Install Github with latest integration
npx bp add github
# Insatll HITL integration version 1.0.2
npx bp add --package-type integration hitl@1.0.2
# Install an integration using its ID
npx bp add intver_01JCKSRFAZ7SKBYRM330PBAG88
```

### Committing Botpress Dependencies to Your Git Repository

To ensure that your project's Botpress dependencies are included in your Git repository, define them in your package.json under the `bpDependencies` field:

```json json
{
  "name": "...",
  "version": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "scripts": {},
  "dependencies": {},
  "bpDependencies": {
    "hitl": "interface:hitl@0.4.0",
    "hitl_integration": "integration:hitl",
    "llm_latest": "llm",
    "llm_7": "llm@7.0.0",
    "github": "github@1.1.5",
    "notion": "intver_01JN9P95XVFF3CNGD248M1WSVK",
    "myIntegration": "../../myIntegration"
  }
}
```

Once defined, you can install all listed integrations at once by running:

```shell sh
bp add -y
```

<br />

The `bpDependencies` object maps keys to package references. The key determines the name of the directory where the package is installed locally. The corresponding values can be one of the following:

* A package ID
* A file path (e.g., a local integration or interface)
* A formatted package reference:
  * name → The package name (defaults to the latest version)
  * \[packageType]name\[@version] → Specifies a package type and version
    * packageType (optional) can be integration, interface, or other relevant types
    * version (optional, defaults to latest) can specify a specific version

This setup ensures consistent dependency management across different environments while keeping locally developed integrations easy to reference.
