Just like the Botpress Studio, the Botpress SDK allows you to create bots. However, instead of using a web interface, you can use code to define your bots. We refer to these bots as **bots-as-code**.

Bots published using the SDK will still be visible in the Botpress Dashboard and can be managed from there, but cannot be edited using the Studio. Opening a bot-as-code in the Studio will display an empty bot.
