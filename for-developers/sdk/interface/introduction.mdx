title: "Introduction to interfaces"

## Overview

Interfaces in the Botpress SDK establish standardized contracts that integrations must implement to enable extra features and capabilities. For example, an integration might implement the `hitl` (human-in-the-loop) interface to support human agent intervention, or the `typing-indicator` interface to utilize typing indicators provided by the external service.

<Warning>Interface creation is **currently restricted to the Botpress Team**. Support for developer-created interfaces _may_ be introduced in future releases at Botpress's sole discretion.</Warning>

## Interface Definition

Each interface is defined through an Interface Definition that specifies the contract integrations must fulfill.

## Key Components of Interface Definitions

### Events

Interfaces can define events that implementing integrations must support. These events establish a consistent model for how activities are communicated to bots, regardless of the underlying external service.

### Actions

Interfaces specify actions that implementing integrations must provide. These actions define standardized operations that bots can invoke across different integrations that implement the same interface.

### Channels

Interfaces can define communication channel requirements that implementing integrations must implement.

### Entities

Entities are a concept specific to interfaces that define standardized data structures. These entities:

- Establish common data models across different integrations
- Allow implementing integrations to extend and customize the base entity

## Component Renaming

<Tip>
Events, actions, channels, and entities defined by an interface can all be renamed by implementing integrations to better align with the concepts and terminology of their specific external service. Entities can also be extended with additional fields to accommodate the unique requirements of the external service.
</Tip>

## Example: The `listable` Interface

Consider a `listable` interface designed to provide standardized listing functionality across different services:

### Interface Definition
- Defines an `item` entity as a base structure for listable resources
- Specifies a `listItems` action that returns `item` results

### GitHub Integration Implementation
An integration connecting to GitHub might implement this interface as follows:

- Extends the `item` entity to create a `pullRequest` entity with GitHub-specific fields
- Renames the `listItems` action to `listPullRequests` to reflect GitHub terminology
- Implements the required functionality while using terminology that makes sense for GitHub

### Slack Integration Implementation
Similarly, a Slack integration might implement the same interface differently:

- Extends the `item` entity to create a `channel` entity with Slack-specific properties
- Renames the `listItems` action to `listChannels` to reflect Slack terminology
- Provides the same core capability but adapted to Slack's specific requirements

## Benefits of Interfaces

Interfaces provide significant benefits to the Botpress ecosystem:

- **Consistency**: Bots can interact with diverse external services through a standardized approach
- **Reusability**: Plugins can build upon interface capabilities without concern for the specific implementing integration
- **Adaptability**: Integrations can fulfill interface requirements while maintaining terminology appropriate to their external service
- **Extensibility**: New integrations can quickly provide established functionality by implementing existing interfaces
