To get started, install the Botpress CLI globally on your machine. The CLI includes the Botpress SDK and other useful packages for developing with Botpress.

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g @botpress/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install -g @botpress/cli
```

```bash yarn
yarn add -g @botpress/cli
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>All the examples in this section use `npm`, but feel free to use the package manager of your choice like `yarn` or `pnpm`.</Note>

You can check that your installation was successful by running the following command:

```bash
bp --help
```
