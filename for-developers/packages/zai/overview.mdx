Zai is an LLM utility library that provides a clean, type-safe API for common AI operations. For example, you can use Zai's methods to programmatically:

- Extract structured data from an unstructured prompt
- Verify a Boolean condition within a piece of content
- Generate or summarize text

We recommend using Zai with the [Botpress SDK](/for-developers/sdk/overview) to help process LLM inputs and outputs.

<Note>

  For a full list of available methods, check out the [reference section](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference).

<Tip>

  Zai is imported by default in [Execute Code Cards](https://botpress.com/docs/learn/guides/advanced/use-code#execute-code-cards), [Actions](/learn/guides/advanced/use-code#actions), and [Hooks](learn/guides/advanced/use-code#hooks).

</Tip>

## Installation

To install Zai for local development, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @botpress/zai @botpress/client @bpinternal/zui
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @botpress/zai @botpress/client @bpinternal/zui
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @botpress/zai @botpress/client @bpinternal/zui
```

</CodeGroup>

This also installs:

- The [official Botpress client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/client), which is necessary to create a Zai instance
- The [internal Zui library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bpinternal/zui), which helps create Zod schemas for many of Zai's methods

## Quick start

To get started, import the libraries and create a new `Client` object using your Bot ID and Personal Access Token (PAT):

```ts
import { Client } from '@botpress/client'
import { Zai } from '@botpress/zai'
import { z } from '@bpinternal/zui'

const client = new Client({ botId: 'YOUR_BOT_ID', token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' })
```

Then, create a new `Zai` instance and pass in the `Client`:

```ts
const zai = new Zai({ client })
```

<Note>

  If you're using Zai [within Botpress Studio](/learn/guides/advanced/use-code), you don't need to create a new `Zai` instanceâ€”it's already available globally as `zai`.

</Note>

## Usage examples

Here are some examples of how you can use Zai:

### Get structured data from text

Use the [`extract`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#extract) method to get structured data from a plain piece of text:

```ts
const text = "Blueberries are 3.99$ and are in stock."
const product = await zai.extract(
  text,
  z.object({
    name: z.string(), // Returns "blueberries"
    price: z.number(), // Returns 3.99
    inStock: z.boolean(), // Returns true
  })
)
```

### Verify a condition

Use the [`check`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#check) method to verify a condition against some input:

```ts
const result = await zai.check(email, 'is spam')
const { value, explanation } = await result.result()
```

### Filter an array

Use the [`filter`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#filter) method to filter elements of an array based on a condition:

```ts
const comments = [
  "Great product, I love it!",
  "This is terrible spam content",
  "Very helpful review, thank you"
]
const cleanComments = await zai.filter(comments, 'is not spam or inappropriate')
// Returns: ["Great product, I love it!", "Very helpful review, thank you"]
```

### Label content with categories

Use the [`label`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#label) method to categorize content with predefined labels:

```ts
const email = "Congratulations! You've won $1,000,000! Click here now!"
const result = await zai.label(email, {
  spam: 'is this email spam?',
  urgent: 'does this email require immediate attention?',
  promotional: 'is this email promotional content?'
})
// Returns: { spam: true, urgent: false, promotional: true }
```

### Rewrite text according to instructions

Use the [`rewrite`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#rewrite) method to transform text based on specific instructions:

```ts
const original = "The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 3pm."
const rewritten = await zai.rewrite(
  original,
  'Make this sound more professional and formal'
)
// Returns: "The meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow at 3:00 PM."
```

### Summarize long content

Use the [`summarize`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#summarize) method to create concise summaries of lengthy text:

```ts
const longArticle = "..." // Long article content
const summary = await zai.summarize(longArticle, {
  length: 100, // tokens
  prompt: 'key findings and main conclusions'
})
// Returns: A concise summary focusing on key findings
```

### Generate text from prompts

Use the [`text`](/for-developers/packages/zai/reference#text) method to generate content based on prompts:

```ts
const blogPost = await zai.text(
  'Write a brief introduction about the benefits of AI in customer service',
  { length: 200 }
)
// Returns: Generated text about AI benefits in customer service
```
