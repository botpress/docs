Botpress Desk generates a **Ticket Intelligence Report** from your Intercom inbox. The report is built from your real conversations and ticket volume and includes:

- **Per-ticket automation scores** by ticket type and workflow
- **ROI and time-saved estimates** based on observed volume and handling patterns
- A **ranked implementation roadmap** from quick wins to larger initiatives
- **CX performance breakdowns** tied to customer impact, with supporting examples from your inbox

This is not a survey product. Desk analyzes resolved conversations to infer satisfaction and identify where automation and workflow changes will have the highest impact.

## How conversations become intelligence

### Connect and sync (OAuth)

When you connect your Intercom workspace to Desk via OAuth, Desk securely syncs the minimum data required to generate the report:

- Admins
- Contacts
- Conversations, including messages and notes
- Assignment history and status changes

Desk maps each Intercom conversation to a normalized **ticket**. Ticket messages are represented as **activities**, and metadata (assignees, timestamps, status transitions) is stored alongside the conversation content to support analysis.

## What Desk analyzes

### Satisfaction analysis (CSAT), inferred from conversations

Desk infers customer satisfaction from each resolved conversation without requiring customers to answer a survey.

When a ticket is resolved, Desk:

1. Collects customer messages from the ticket.
2. Analyzes tone, language, and resolution indicators (for example: “thank you” vs “still broken”).
3. Produces an AI-inferred CSAT label: **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.
4. Attaches a **confidence score** (0 to 100%) and a short **reason summary**.

If an explicit Intercom satisfaction rating exists (for example thumbs up/down), that rating is recorded and takes priority.

### Topic extraction and tagging

Desk scans analyzed tickets for product, feature, and operational topics discussed in the conversation (for example: onboarding, billing, SSO, API, permissions).

These topics are stored as tags and are used to:

- Break down satisfaction by area
- Cluster tickets by theme
- Identify repeated requests and common failure modes
- Power automation opportunity grouping in the report

### Automation scoring (per ticket type and workflow)

Desk estimates automation potential for patterns found in your inbox, including ticket types and recurring workflows.

Automation scoring is derived from signals such as:

- Frequency and consistency of the conversation pattern
- Repetition across tickets (similar steps, similar questions, similar data requests)
- Evidence of structured processes (permissions checks, identity verification, account lookups, policy gating)
- Message volume and back-and-forth, as a proxy for avoidable work
- Whether resolution depends on data that can be retrieved via integrations or APIs
- Risk flags (policy sensitivity, edge-case likelihood, brand risk), which can reduce the score

Outputs include:

- **Automation potential score** (0 to 100) with a short rationale
- Recommended automation approach (deflection, workflow automation, agent-assisted, or human-only)
- Supporting examples from your inbox

### ROI and time saved estimates

For each automation opportunity, Desk calculates estimated impact using your observed ticket volume and handling patterns.

Typical outputs:

- Estimated **time saved** per ticket and per period (for example: hours per 100 tickets, or hours per month)
- Estimated **cost savings**, based on time saved and a configurable labor cost assumption
- A confidence indicator based on how consistent the pattern is in your data

These numbers are estimates, grounded in your inbox data and the report’s assumptions. They are not derived from industry benchmarks.

### Ranked implementation roadmap

Desk prioritizes opportunities into a roadmap using a combination of:

- Impact (time saved and cost savings)
- Effort (complexity, number of steps, integrations required)
- Risk (policy and customer experience risk, edge cases)
- Confidence (how well the opportunity is supported by your data)

The roadmap is structured so teams can start with high-confidence quick wins and then move into more complex initiatives.

## What you get in the Ticket Intelligence report

### CX performance breakdowns

Desk surfaces operational metrics that indicate hidden cost and customer friction, such as:

- Signals of abandonment risk (for example: tickets that drop off after long waits)
- Customer “nudge” behavior (follow-ups like “any update?”)
- Average messages per ticket and back-and-forth intensity
- CSAT breakdowns and drivers, tied to topics

Each section includes specific examples from your inbox and a recommended fix (for example: adjust triage, reduce repeated permission requests, add after-hours coverage, introduce self-serve).

### Automation opportunities ranked by ROI

A prioritized list of ticket types and workflows with:

- Automation potential scores
- Frequency and volume context
- Estimated time saved and cost savings
- Implementation effort and risk notes
- Suggested automation approach and required systems

### Workflow friction with customer impact

A workflow-level view of where tickets get stuck, including:

- Wait times and excessive agent follow-ups
- Manual steps that repeat across tickets
- Clear candidate automation paths, step by step

## Security and privacy

- **Read-only permissions:** Desk requests the minimum OAuth scopes needed to read required data. No write access.
- **Does not post to Intercom:** Desk does not send messages, update tickets, or modify workspace data.
- **Auto-delete after 14 days:** Fetched conversation data is automatically deleted 14 days after report generation.
- **Shareable report links use random IDs:** Report URLs are unguessable identifiers with no sequential IDs and no workspace names embedded.

---

## Getting started

1. **Connect Intercom** from Desk settings and complete OAuth.
2. **Import conversations** with one click.
3. **Wait for report generation**. The report is generated automatically after import completes.
4. **Review the report** and use the ranked roadmap to choose what to implement first.

New conversations are analyzed automatically as they resolve. No additional configuration is required.
