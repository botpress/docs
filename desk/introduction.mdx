## What makes Desk different?

Desk is a support workspace built for how real support teams operate: fast triage, clear context, and human oversight that stays part of the workflow. AI helps where it's reliable, and routes to an agent when judgment matters.

## Integrations

Desk is designed for gradual adoption. We'll help you import your existing customers and data from your existing support solution, like Intercom or Zendesk.

Then, all your customer interactions sync when you take actions on either platform, so there's no risk.
