            - A [professional Instagram account](https://help.instagram.com/138925576505882?helpref=faq_content). If you have a personal Instagram account, the setup wizard will ask you to switch to a professional account.
        </Info>

        1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
        2. Search for the **Instagram** integration, then select **Install Integration**.

    <Warning>
        ### Manual configuration is temporarily unavailable

        We're currently updating the integration to support the latest version of the Instagram API. This means the option to manually configure your Instagram integration is temporarily unavailable.

        If your app uses v20.0 (or earlier) of the Instagram API, you can still follow the steps below. Otherwise, you can set up the integration using [basic configuration](#basic-configuration) or test it in the [playground](#playground).


    </Warning>

        You can also manually configure the Instagram integration with your own Meta app.

        <Info>

            You will need:

            - A [published bot](/learn/get-started/quick-start)
            - A [Meta developer app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/creation/). Check out the [Meta developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform) to learn more about the setup process.
            - A [professional Instagram account](https://help.instagram.com/138925576505882?helpref=faq_content). If you have a personal Instagram account, the setup wizard will ask you to switch to a professional account.

                        2. Expand **Generate access tokens**. Then, copy the number under your Instagram account handle.

                2. Select **API setup with Instagram login**.
                3. Under **Configure webhooks**, paste your Botpress webhook URL into the **Callback URL** field.
                4. In the **Verify token** field, enter the same token you created in the [previous step](integrations/integration-guides/instagram#verify-token).
                5. Select **Verify and save**.

                <Note>
                    If you receive an error message after selecting **Verify and save**, make sure you saved your integration's configuration properly in the previous step.
                </Note>

                6. Now,  select the required subscriptions for your webhook. Select **Add Subscriptions**, then select:
                    - `messages`
                    - `messaging_postbacks`
                    - `instagram_manage_messages` (if your app has been [reviewed by Meta](#submit-your-app-for-meta-review)
                7. Select **Save**.
            </Step>
        </Steps>
        <Check>
            You’ve manually configured your Instagram integration!
        </Check>

        ### Submit your app for Meta review
        After setup is complete, you can submit your app for [review by Meta](/integrations/integration-guides/instagram#submit-your-app-for-meta-review), the parent company of WhatsApp. This verification confirms the identity and eligibility of your business to use Meta’s platforms.

        While the review is pending, your bot will work for admins, developers, and testers of the app only. After your app is approved and made public, it will work for the general public as well.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Playground">
        If you want to test your bot’s behaviour in Instagram before going through the actual setup process, you can use the Instagram integration playground.

            - A [published bot](/learn/get-started/quick-start)
            - A [professional Instagram account](https://help.instagram.com/138925576505882?helpref=faq_content). If you have a personal Instagram account, the setup wizard will ask you to switch to a professional account.
