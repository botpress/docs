description: Integrate your bot with Zendesk using the official integration.
---

The official Zendesk integration allows you to create and manage support tickets directly from your bot. You can also assign a Zendesk agent to communicate directly with the user, all within the same conversation initially handled by the bot.

<Tip>
Your Zendesk agent can continue the conversation on any messaging channel supported by Botpress. For example:

- [Webchat](/webchat/)
- [WhatsApp](/integrations/integration-guides/whatsapp/)
- [Messenger](/integrations/integration-guides/messenger)
</Tip>

## Setup
