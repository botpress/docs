The official MailerLite integration allows your bot to create, update, fetch, or delete your MailerLite subscribers.

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [published bot](/learn/get-started/quick-start)
  - A [MailerLite account](https://www.mailerlite.com/signup)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the integration in Botpress">
    First, install the integration to your bot:

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **MailerLite** integration, then select **Install Integration**.

    In the **Configuration** menu, you should see one field: **API Key**. Leave it empty for nowâ€”you'll come back to it after creating your MailerLite API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a MailerLite developer API key">
    Next, create a MailerLite API key:

    1. [Log in to your MailerLite account](https://accounts.mailerlite.com/?lang=en).
    2. Select **Integrations** from the left navigation bar.
    3. To the right of **API**, select **Use**.
    4. Select **Generate new token**. Enter a name, then select **Create token**.
    5. Copy the API  token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the integration in Botpress">
    Now, you can finish setting up the integration in Botpress:

    1. In the integration's **API Key** field, paste your MailerLite developer API key.
    2. Select **Save Configuration**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you run into errors when using the integration's Cards, check out your bot's [Logs](/learn/reference/debugger-logs-json#logs) and locate the error message:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    title="An unexpected error occurred"
  >
    Your developer API token may have been revoked. [Create a new one](#setup) and update your bot's configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Invalid JSON"
  >
    If you're passing data into the [Upsert Subscriber](#upsert-subscriber) Card's [`customFields`](#param-custom-fields) parameter, make sure it's a valid JSON string of key-value pairs..
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
