    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/)
      - Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
    </Info>

    ### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud project

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Open the project picker dropdown in the top navigation. Then, select **New Project**.

      </Step>
      <Step>
        Enter your project details:
        - **Project name**: Choose a descriptive name for your project.
        - **Organization**: Select your organization (if applicable).
        - **Location**: Choose the appropriate location.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select **Create** and wait for the project to be created.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Verify you're in the correct project by checking the project name next to the Google logo.

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 2: Enable the Google Sheets API

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        In the Google Cloud Console, open the left sidebar and go to **API & Services > Credentials**.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select **+ Create Credentials > API Key** to create an API key.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Go to **Library**, search for "Google Sheets API", and select **Enable**.


      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 3: Create a service account

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Open the left sidebar and go to **API & Services > Credentials**.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select **+ Create Credentials > Service Account**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Enter a **Service account name**. The Service Account ID will be automatically generated.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        The remaining fields are optional. Select **Done** to create the service account.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select your newly created service account, then go to the **Keys** tab.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select **Add Key > Create new key**, choose **JSON** as the key type, then select **Create**.



        A JSON file will be downloaded to your machine. Keep this file secure—you'll need it to configure the integration.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      The downloaded JSON file contains sensitive credentials. Store it securely and never share it publicly. The file structure looks like this:

      ```json
      {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "your-project-id",
        "private_key_id": "...",
        "private_key": "...",
        "client_email": "your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "...",
        "auth_uri": "...",
        "token_uri": "...",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "...",
        "client_x509_cert_url": "...",
        "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
      }
      ```
    </Note>

    ### Step 4: Grant spreadsheet access to the service account

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet in your browser.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select the **Share** button in the upper-right corner.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Open the JSON file you downloaded and copy the `client_email` value.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Paste the `client_email` into the **Add people and groups** field, as if you were inviting someone to access your spreadsheet.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Set the permission to **Editor** so the bot can read and write to the spreadsheet. Then select **Send**.


      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 5: Configure the integration in Botpress

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.


      </Step>
      <Step>
        Search for the **Google Sheets** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        In the **Configuration** menu, select the drop-down and choose **Configure manually with a Service Account Key**.


      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Fill in the integration's configuration fields:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Spreadsheet ID">
        1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet in your browser.
        2. Copy the ID from the URL. The ID is the string between `/d/` and `/edit` in the URL.


        For example, if your URL is `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz/edit`, the Spreadsheet ID is `1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz`.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Client Email">
        Open the JSON file you downloaded in [Step 3](#step-3-create-a-service-account) and copy the `client_email` value.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Private Key">
        Open the JSON file you downloaded in [Step 3](#step-3-create-a-service-account) and copy the entire `private_key` value, including the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` markers.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    When you've filled in all the fields, select **Save Configuration**.

    <Check>
      You've successfully configured the Google Sheets integration!

  For Cards that take [named ranges](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63175?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) as input, Google's standard restrictions for range names apply. Range names:

  - Can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
  - Can't start with a number, or the words "true" or "false"
  - Can't contain any spaces or punctuation
  - Must be 1–250 characters
