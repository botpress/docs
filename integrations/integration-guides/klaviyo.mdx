The official Klaviyo integration allows your bot to interact with your Klaviyo account. You can use it to:

- Create or update user profiles
- Retrieve individual or bulk user profile data
- Subscribe users to SMS/email marketing


## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [published bot](/learn/get-started/quick-start)
  - A [Klaviyo account](https://www.klaviyo.com/sign-up)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the integration in Botpress">

  First, install the integration to your bot:

  1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
  2. Search for the **Klaviyo** integration, then select **Install Integration**.

  In the **Configuration** menu, you should see one field: **API Key**. Leave it empty for now—you'll come back to it after creating your Klaviyo API key.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Klaviyo private API key">

  Next, create a private Klaviyo API key:

  1. [Log in to your Klaviyo account](https://www.klaviyo.com/login).
  2. Select your organization's name in the bottom-left corner.
  3. Select **Settings**. Then, navigate to **API keys**.
  4. Under **Private API Keys**, select **Create Private API Key**.
  5. Enter a name for the API key.
  6. Check **Full Access** for the following API scopes:
      - **Profiles**
      - **Subscriptions**
  7. Select **Create** in the upper-right corner.
  8. Copy the API key—it should start with `pk`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the integration in Botpress">

  Now, you can finish setting up the integration in Botpress:

  1. In the integration's **API Key** field, paste your Klaviyo API key.
  2. Select **Save Configuration**.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Your Klaviyo integration is ready. You can use the integration's [Cards](#cards) to interact with your Klaviyo account.
</Check>

## Cards

<Warning>
  If you use any of the following Cards in an [Autonomous Node](/learn/reference/nodes/autonomous-node), keep in mind that your bot will fill in the Card's fields based on the user's responses. This can lead to unexpected behaviour for fields that have strict conventions.

  For example, the [Update Profile](#update-profile) Card lets you update [custom properties](#param-custom-properties-2) associated with a profile. If the user isn't specific about that property's exact name, the bot may accidentally create a new property instead of updating an existing one.
</Warning>
