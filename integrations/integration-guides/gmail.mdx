The Gmail integration allows your bot to chat with users via your Gmail address.

<Danger>
    Once you've successfully configured the Gmail integration, **the email address you provided will begin responding to all incoming emails as your bot**. Please be aware of this behaviour before configuring the integration.
</Danger>

## Setup

Due to the sensitive nature of email communication, the Gmail integration requires a secure connection between Botpress and Gmail. To establish this secure connection, you need to configure the Gmail integration using OAuth.

    <Tab title="Automatic configuration">
        <Warning>
            ### Automatic configuration is temporarily unavailable

            The Gmail integration is currently undergoing a verification process by Google. This means the option to automatically configure your Gmail integration is temporarily unavailable.

            You can still set up the integration using [manual configuration](#manual-configuration).

            {/* ### Automatic configuration with OAuth

            To set up the Gmail integration using OAuth, click the authorization button and follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Botpress bot to Gmail.

            When using this configuration mode, a Botpress-managed Gmail application will be used to connect to your Gmail account. However, actions taken by the bot will be attributed to the user who authorized the connection, rather than the application. For this reason, **we do not recommend using personal Gmail accounts** for this integration. You should set up a service account and use this account to authorize the connection.

            #### Configuring the integration in Botpress

            1. Authorize the Gmail integration by clicking the authorization button.
            2. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Botpress bot to Gmail.
            3. Once the connection is established, you can save the configuration and enable the integration. */}

        <Tip>
        For example, if:
        
        - Your integration's webhook URL is: `https://webhook.botpress.cloud/57fcfb04-51fd-4381-909a-10e6ae53d310`
        - Your shared secret is `Ut5hzrxs7uV87mzCAKL3ztrzesWWBiNa`
        
        You would enter:
        
        `https://webhook.botpress.cloud/57fcfb04-51fd-4381-909a-10e6ae53d310?shared_secret=Ut5hzrxs7uV87mzCAKL3ztrzesWWBiNa`
        
        in the **Endpoint URL** field.
        </Tip>

        8. Check the **Enable authentication** checkbox.
        9. Select the service account email address you created earlier in the **Service account** field.

        14. Select **Create** to create the subscription.

        ### Step 10. Authorize the OAuth application

        1. On Gmail, log in to the Google account you want to use with the Gmail integration.
        2. Once logged in, go to the following URL in your browser:

        `
        https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send&access_type=offline&prompt=consent&redirect_uri=https://botpress.com&client_id=
        `

        <Note>
        Make sure to add your OAuth **Client ID** from [Step 4](#step-4-create-oauth-credentials) to the end of the URL. For example, if your OAuth client ID is `abcd`, the URL should end with `&client_id=abcd`.
        </Note>

        3. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the OAuth application with your personal Gmail account.

        <Warning>
            After completing the authorization, you will be redirected to [botpress.com](https://botpress.com). Do not close this page.
        </Warning>

        4. Copy the **authorization code** from the URL in your browser's address bar. The authorization code is the string that appears after `code=` and before `&scope=` in the URL.

        <Tip>
        If you have difficulty finding the authorization code in the URL, you can use online tools like https://semalt.tools/en/url-parser or https://parseurlonline.com.
        </Tip>

        5. You can now safely close this page.

        ### Step 11. Configure the integration in Botpress

        1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
        2. Search for the **Gmail** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
        3. In the Configuration menu, select **Configure manually with your own GCP App**.
        4. Fill in the required fields with all the information you saved from the previous steps.

        <Warning>
        The authorization code is only valid for a short period of time. If the code has expired, you will need to repeat the steps outlined in [Step 10](#step-10-authorize-the-oauth-application).
        </Warning>

        10. Select **Save Configuration**. If no error message is displayed, the integration was successfully configured.
    </Tab>
