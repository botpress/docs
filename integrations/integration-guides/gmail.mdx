The Gmail integration allows your bot to chat with users via your Gmail address.

<Danger>
    Once you've successfully configured the Gmail integration, **the email address you provided will begin responding to all incoming emails as your bot**. Please be aware of this behaviour before configuring the integration.
</Danger>

## Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic configuration">
    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/)
    </Info>

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **Gmail** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
    3. In the **Configuration** menu, select **Authorize Gmail**.
    4. Follow the instructions to connect Botpress to your Google account.

    <Note>
      When using basic configuration, a Botpress-managed Gmail application will be used to connect to your Gmail account. However, actions taken by the bot will be attributed to the user who authorized the connection rather than the application.

      For this reason, **we don't recommend using personal Gmail accounts** for this integration. You should set up a [service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) and use that account to authorize the connection.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual configuration">
  For more advanced use cases, you can manually configure the integration.

    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/)
      - Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

    3. Select **Create service account**.
    4. Enter a name for the service account. Then, select **Done**.

        <Note>
        You don't need to grant any roles to the service account, as it will only be used to sign webhook events.
        </Note>
    5. Copy the service account email address for use in the next steps.

        <Tip>
        The service account email address is the string that ends with `.gserviceaccount.com`.
        </Tip>

    ### Step 6. Create a Pub/Sub topic

    1. In Google Cloud Console, search for and navigate to the **Pub/Sub** section.
    2. Select **Topics** in the left sidebar.
    3. Select **Create topic**.

    7. Copy the **Topic name** for use in the next steps.

        <Note>
        The topic name is the string that starts with `projects/`.
        </Note>

    ### Step 7. Grant publish rights on the Pub/Sub topic

    1. In Google Cloud Console, search for and navigate to the **Pub/Sub** section.
    2. Select **Topics** in the left sidebar.
    3. From the topic list, find the topic you created earlier. Then, select the triple-dot <kbd>⋮</kbd> button on the right.
    4. Select **View permissions** from the dropdown menu.
    5. Select **Add principal**.
    6. Under **Add principals**, enter `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com`.

        <Note>
        This service account is managed by Google and is used to push events to Pub/Sub.
        </Note>
    7. Under **Assign roles**, select `Pub/Sub Publisher`.
    8. Select **Save** to grant publish rights to the service account.

    ### Step 8. Generate a shared secret

    1. Generate an alphanumeric string to use as a shared secret for signing Pub/Sub push events. We recommend using a string with at least 32 characters.

        <Tip>
        You can use an [online password generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/) to create a secure string.
        </Tip>
    2. Copy this string for use in the next steps.

    ### Step 9. Create a Pub/Sub subscription

    2. Select **Subscriptions** in the left sidebar.
    3. Select **Create subscription**.
    4. Enter a name for the subscription in the **Subscription ID** field.
    5. Select the topic you created earlier from the topic dropdown.
    6. Under **Delivery type**, select **Push**.
    7. Enter your integration's Botpress-provided webhook URL in the **Endpoint URL** field. To this URL, add `?shared_secret=`, followed by the shared secret you generated earlier.

        <Tip>
        For example, if:

        - Your integration's webhook URL is: `https://webhook.botpress.cloud/57fcfb04-51fd-4381-909a-10e6ae53d310`
        - Your shared secret is `Ut5hzrxs7uV87mzCAKL3ztrzesWWBiNa`

        You would enter:

        `https://webhook.botpress.cloud/57fcfb04-51fd-4381-909a-10e6ae53d310?shared_secret=Ut5hzrxs7uV87mzCAKL3ztrzesWWBiNa`

        in the **Endpoint URL** field.
        </Tip>
    8. Check the **Enable authentication** checkbox.
    9. Select the service account email address you created earlier in the **Service account** field.
    10. Enter the shared secret you generated earlier in the **Audience** field.

        <Note>
          Although this field is marked optional in Google Console, it's required for the integration to work properly.
        </Note>
    11. Under **Expiration period**, select **Never expire**.
    12. Under **Acknowledgement deadline**, enter 60 seconds.
    13. Under **Retry policy**, select **Retry after exponential backoff delay**. Set the minimum backoff to 60 seconds and the maximum backoff to 600 seconds.
    14. Select **Create** to create the subscription.

    ### Step 10. Authorize the OAuth application

    1. On Gmail, log in to the Google account you want to use with the Gmail integration.
    2. Once logged in, go to the following URL in your browser:

        ```
        https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=https://mail.google.com/%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send&access_type=offline&prompt=consent&redirect_uri=https://botpress.com&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your OAuth **Client ID** from [Step 4](#step-4-create-oauth-credentials). For example, if your OAuth client ID is `abcd`, the URL should end with `&client_id=abcd`.

    3. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the OAuth application with your personal Gmail account.

        <Warning>
            After completing the authorization, you will be redirected to [botpress.com](https://botpress.com). Don't close this page.
        </Warning>
    4. Copy the **authorization code** from the URL in your browser's address bar. The authorization code is the string that appears after `code=` and before `&scope=` in the URL.

        <Tip>
        If you have difficulty finding the authorization code in the URL, you can use online tools like https://semalt.tools/en/url-parser or https://parseurlonline.com.
        </Tip>

        <Note>
        If you update any scopes, you need to generate a new authorization code and add it to the integration's configuration in Botpress Studio. The previous authorization code won't have the correct scope permissions.
        </Note>
    5. You can now safely close this page.

    ### Step 11. Configure the integration in Botpress

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **Gmail** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
    3. In the **Configuration** menu, select **Configure manually with your own GCP App**.
    4. Fill in the required fields with all the information you saved from the previous steps.

        <Warning>
        The authorization code is only valid for a short period of time. If the code has expired, you will need to repeat the steps outlined in [Step 10](#step-10-authorize-the-oauth-application).
        </Warning>
    5. Select **Save Configuration**. If no error message is displayed, the integration was successfully configured.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using the integration

Once you’ve successfully configured the integration, the email address you provided will begin responding to all incoming messages as your bot. If this is your desired behaviour, no additional setup is required.

You can also use the integration's [Cards](#cards) to interact with your Gmail inbox. This allows you to manage threads, drafts, attachments, and other data associated with your inbox.
