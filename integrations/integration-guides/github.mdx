The official GitHub integration allows your bot to interact with your GitHub repositories.

## Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic configuration">

    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
    </Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Search for the **GitHub** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        In the **Configuration** menu, select **Authorize GitHub**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Follow the instructions to connect Botpress to your GitHub account.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      When using this configuration mode, a Botpress-managed GitHub App connects to your GitHub organizations and repositories. The app has the necessary permissions to listen to pull request and issue events and to create comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions.

      If you need more granular control over permissions or prefer to use your own GitHub App, choose one of the manual configuration options instead.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual with GitHub App">

    For advanced use cases, you can use your own GitHub App with our integration.

    <Info>
      You will need:

    </Steps>

    ### Step 7: Configure the integration in Botpress

    Finally, fill in the integration's configuration fields:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="GitHub App ID">
        1. In your GitHub App's **General** tab, find the **App ID** field.
        2. Copy the App ID and paste it into the **GitHub App ID** field in Botpress.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="GitHub App Private Key">
        Open the `.pem` file you downloaded earlier and paste its entire contents into the **GitHub App Private Key** field.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="GitHub Webhook Secret">
        Paste the webhook secret key you generated in [Step 2](#step-2:-create-a-github-app) into the **GitHub Webhook Secret** field.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="GitHub App Installation ID">
        1. Navigate to your organization's **Settings > Installed GitHub Apps**.
        2. Find your newly installed GitHub App and select **Configure**.
        3. Look at the URL—it should end with `/installations/:installation_id`. For example, in `https://github.com/organizations/my-org/settings/installations/123456`, the installation ID is `123456`.
        4. Copy the installation ID and paste it into the **GitHub App Installation ID** field in Botpress.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    When you've filled in all the fields, select **Save Configuration**. This will automatically enable your integration.

    <Check>
      You've manually configured your GitHub integration with a GitHub App!
    </Check>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual with Personal Access Token (PAT)">

    You can also use a Personal Access Token (PAT) to connect your GitHub account to Botpress.

    <Warning>
      When you use a PAT, actions taken by the bot will be attributed to your personal GitHub account. If you want actions attributed to your organization, use the [GitHub App configuration](#manual-with-github-app) instead.

      GitHub Apps also don't consume a seat in your organization and offer more granular permissions—we recommend using them for production use cases.
    </Warning>

    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
