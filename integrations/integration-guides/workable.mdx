The official Workable integration allows your bot to create and manage your Workable candidates.

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [published bot](/learn/get-started/quick-start)
  - A [Workable account](https://id.workable.com/oidc/i/BtMboWMgw2NuejkYxadf_)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the integration in Botpress">
    First, install the integration to your bot:

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **Workable** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
    3. Fill in the **Account subdomain** field with your company's subdomain (`https://mycompany.workable.com`)
    4. Leave the **API access token** field empty for now—you'll come back to them after getting your Workable API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Workable API key">
    Next, get your Workable API key:

    1. [Log in to your Workable dashboard](https://id.workable.com/oidc/i/BtMboWMgw2NuejkYxadf_).
    2. Select your profile picture and go to **Settings**.
    3. In the left navigation bar, go to **Integrations > Apps**.
    4. Scroll to **API Access Tokens**, then select **Generate API token**.
    5. Add the `r_candidates` and `w_candidates` scopes.
    6. Copy the generated token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the integration in Botpress">
    Now, you can finish setting up the integration in Botpress:

    1. In the integration's **API access token** field, paste your Workable API key.
    2. Select **Save Configuration**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Your integration is ready. You can use the integration's [Cards](#cards) and [Triggers](#triggers) to interact with your Workable candidates.
