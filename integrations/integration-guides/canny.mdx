The official Canny integration allows your bot to manage posts and comments in your Canny feature request boards.

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
  - A [Canny account](https://canny.io/register)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the integration in Botpress">
    First, install the integration to your bot:

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **Canny** integration, then select **Install Integration**.

    In the **Configuration** menu, you should see one field: **API key**. Leave it empty for now—you'll come back to it after getting your Canny API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Canny API key">
    Next, get your Canny API key:

    1. [Log in to your Canny dashboard](https://canny.io/login).
    2. In the top-right corner, select your profile icon and go to **Settings**.
    3. From the left sidebar, go to **API**.
    4. Copy your API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the integration in Botpress">
    Now, you can finish setting up the integration in Botpress:

    1. In the integration's **API Key** field, paste your Canny API key.
    2. Select **Save Configuration**.
  </Step>
</Steps>
