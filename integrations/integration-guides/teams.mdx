The Microsoft Teams integration allows your bot to chat with members of your Teams workspace.

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
  - A [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/) business account
  - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca) account that uses the same email address as your Microsoft 365 account
</Info>

### Step 1: Create an Azure app registration

First, create an Azure app registration:

1. Log in to your  [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Using the search bar, go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) page.
3. Select **New registration** and fill in the required fields.

  <Note>
    In the **Supported account types** section, choose the account type that's most appropriate for your use case—we support both [single tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/develop/identity-supported-account-types#accounts-in-this-organizational-directory-only---single-tenant) (app available for your organization only) and [multitenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/develop/identity-supported-account-types#accounts-in-any-organizational-directory-only---multitenant) (public app) accounts.
  </Note>

4. When you're done filling in the fields, select **Register**.

### Step 2: Setup in Botpress

Next, setup the integration in Botpress:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the integration in Botpress">

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **<Icon icon="boxes"/> Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **Microsoft Teams** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the integration in Botpress">
    To configure the integration, you need to create a webhook endpoint for the Teams integration. To do this, fill in the integration's **Configuration** fields using information from your Azure app:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion
        title="App ID"
      >
        In the **Overview** section of your Azure app, copy the **Application (client) ID**. Then, paste it in the **App ID** field in Botpress.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion
        title="App Password"
      >
        1. In your Azure app's left sidebar, go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets**.
        2. Select **New client secret**.
        3. Set a description and expiry date for your secret.
        4. Copy the **Value** of the generated secret.
        5. Paste it in the **App Password** field in Botpress.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion
        title="Tenant ID"
      >
        In the **Overview** section of your Azure app, copy the **Directory (tenant) ID**. Then, paste it in the **Tenant ID** field in Botpress.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    When you’ve filled in all the fields, select **Save Configuration**. This will automatically enable your integration.
  </Step>
  </Steps>

### Step 3: Create a Microsoft bot

  <Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Microsoft bot">
    Now, you need to create a Microsoft bot. This bot communicates with your Botpress webhook URL to chat with members of your Teams workspace.

    1. In your Azure portal homepage, select **Create a resource**.
    2. Search for **Azure Bot**, then select **Create**.
    3. Scroll to the **Creation type** section, then select **Use existing app registration**.
    4. Fill in the **App ID** and **App tenant ID** fields with the same app ID and tenant ID you used to configure the integration in Botpress.
    5. Fill in the other required fields as necessary.
    6. Select **Review + Create**, then **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your Botpress webhook">
    Now that you've created a Microsoft bot, you can use the integration's webhook to connect it to your Botpress bot:

    1. Wait for the bot's deployment to complete, then select **Go to resource**.
    2. In the left sidebar, go to **Settings > Configuration**.
    3. Paste the Botpress webhook URL (starting with `https://webhook.botpress.cloud/`) into the **Messaging endpoint** field. You can find the webhook URL in the integration's configuration menu.
    4. Select **Apply**.
    5. In the left sidebar, go to **Settings > Channels**.
    6. Scroll down and select **Microsoft Teams**.

      <Tip>
        Make sure you actually select the **Microsoft Teams** text, or the channel configuration menu won't open.
      </Tip>

    7. Agree to the terms of service, then select **Apply**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your Microsoft app ID">
    While you're still in the **Settings > Configuration** menu, copy your **Microsoft App ID**—you'll need it for the next steps.
  </Step>
  </Steps>

### Step 4: Create a Teams app

Finally, create an app in your Teams developer portal:

  <Steps>
  <Step title="Setup in Teams developer portal">
    First, create a new app:

    1. Log in to the [Teams developer portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home)
    2. Select **Create a new app** and enter a name for the app.
    3. In the left sidebar, go to the **Basic information** section.
    4. Fill in the required fields:

        - **Short name**

        - **Long description**
        - **Developer or company name**
        - **Website**
        - **Privacy policy**

    <Note>
      This information will be shown to members of your Teams workspace that chat with your bot.
    </Note>

    5. In the **Application (client ID)** field, paste the  **Microsoft App ID** you copied earlier.
    6. At the bottom of the screen, select **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Azure bot to Teams app">
    Next, add your Azure bot to the app:

    1. In the left sidebar, go to **App features** and select **Bot**.
    2. Select **Enter a bot ID**, then paste the **Microsoft App ID** again.
    3. Select the **Personal**, **Team** and **Group** chat scopes.
    4. Select **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure app permissions">
    In the left sidebar, go to **Permissions**. Select the following permissions for your app:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion
        title="Team permissions"
      >

        Under **Application**:

        - `ChannelMessage.Read.Group`
        - `ChannelMessage.Send.Group`
        - `TeamsActivity.Send.Group`
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion
        title="Chat/meeting permissions"
      >
        Under **Application**:

        - `ChatMessage.Read.Chat`
        - `ChatMessage.Send.Chat`
        - `ChatMessageReadReceipt.Read.Chat`
        - `TeamsActivity.Send.Chat`
        - `TeamsTab.ReadWrite.Chat`
        - `TeamsTab.Read.Chat`

        Under **Delegated**:

        - `LiveShareSession.ReadWrite.Chat`
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    When you're done, select **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview in Teams">
    Now, the bot should be fully configured. To test it:

    1. In the upper-right corner, select **Preview in Teams**.
    2. Once the bot has opened in Teams, select **Add**.
    3. After the bot is added, select **Open** to start chatting with it (or a channel to use it in).

    <Note>
      If you get a **Manifest parsing failed** error message, make sure you filled out all the required fields in your app's **Basic Information** section. The **Short description** and **Long description** fields are required, even though they're not marked as such.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  At this point, the bot is only available for you to test. To make it available for anyone in your organization, follow the steps below.
</Note>

### Step 5: Publish the bot to your organization

Finally, you can publish your bot to make it available for anyone in your organization:

1. Go back to your app's menu in the [Teams developer portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home).
2. In the app's left sidebar, go to **Publish > Publish to org**.
3. Select **Get started**.

If you're an admin, your app will be approved automatically. Otherwise, your request to publish the app will need to be approved by an admin in the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps).

<Check>
  Your Teams integration is ready. Once the app has been approved, anyone in your Teams organization can [add it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-an-app-to-microsoft-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77) and chat with your bot.
