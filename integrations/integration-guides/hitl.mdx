The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) integration allows members of your Workspace to:

- Chat directly with users
- Approve AI-generated outputs before they're sent
- Handle complex or sensitive scenarios

<Note>
  The HITL integration needs to be configured before you can use [Human Handoff](/get-started/manage-your-agent/human-handoff).
</Note>

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [Botpress Plus plan](https://botpress.com/pricing) or higher
</Info>

### Step 1: Install the HITL integration

First, install the official HITL integration:

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for the HITL integration, then select **Install Integration**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Install the HITL plugin

    Next, install the official HITL plugin. This will allow you to start HITL from any point in your Workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate back to Botpress Hub and search for the HITL plugin.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select it, then select **Install Plugin**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the **Configuration** menu, open the dropdown under **HITL integration**.

    <Note>
      This dropdown will display all HITL-compatible integrations you've installed. Since this is a guide to the official Botpress HITL integration, we'll select that one for now.
    </Note>
  </Step>
    Select **HITL**.
  <Step>
    Scroll down and select **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The plugin's **Configuration** section contains many optional fields. You can use these to customize your HITL experience.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add the Start HITL card to your Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open a Workflow in Studio and create (or select) any Node.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the **Start HITL** Card at the point where you want to hand off conversations to a live agent:

    <Frame>
      <img
        alt="Start HITL Card"
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="./assets/start-hitl-card.png"
      />
      <img
        alt="Start HITL Card"
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="./assets/start-hitl-card-dark.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the Card's [inspector](/studio/concepts/cards/introduction#configure-a-card), fill in the required fields:

    | Fields              | Description
    | :----------------- | :---------- |
    | **Ticket Title**    | The name of the ticket created for the live agent.                                                                 |
    | **User ID**         | The user ID associated with the ticket. Enter the `{{event.userId}}` variable to use the current user's ID.       |
    | **Conversation ID** | The conversation ID associated with the ticket. Enter the `{{event.conversationId}}` variable to use the current conversation's ID. |
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Done! HITL will begin whenever the **Start HITL** card executes.
