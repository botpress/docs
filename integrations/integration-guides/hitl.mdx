The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) integration brings human oversight and intervention into AI-driven Workflows. It allows members of your Workspace to:

- Chat directly with users
- Approve AI-generated outputs before they're sent
- Handle complex or sensitive scenarios

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [Botpress Plus plan](https://botpress.com/pricing) or higher
</Info>

<Steps titleSize='h3'>
  <Step title="Install the HITL integration to your bot">

    First, install the official HITL integration. This will allow you to respond to users directly within Botpress.

    1. In the Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the HITL integration. Select it, then select **Install Integration**:

    ![Install HITL](./assets/install-hitl.png)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the HITL plugin">

    Next, install the official HITL plugin. This will allow you to start HITL from any point in your Workflow.

    1. Navigate back to Botpress Hub and search for the HITL plugin.
    2. Select it, then select **Install Plugin**:

    ![Install HITL plugin](./assets/install-hitl-plugin.png)

    3. In the **Configuration** menu, open the dropdown under **HITL integration**.

    <Note>
      This dropdown will display all HITL-compatible integrations you've installed. Since this is a guide to the official Botpress HITL integration, we'll select that one for now.
    </Note>

    4. Select **HITL**.
    5. Scroll down and select **Save**.

    <Tip>
      The **Configuration** section contains many optional fields. You can use these to customize your HITL experience.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Start HITL card to your Workflow">

    Now, you can bring a live agent into the conversation anywhere in your Workflow:

    1. Open a Workflow in Studio and create (or select) a Node.
    2. Add the **Start HITL** Card:

    ![Start HITL](./assets/start-hitl.png)

    3. Fill in the required fields:

    | Fields              | Description
    | :----------------- | :---------- |
    | **Ticket Title**    | The name of the ticket created for the live agent.                                                                 |
    | **User ID**         | The user ID associated with the ticket. Enter the `{{event.userId}}` variable to use the current user's ID.       |
    | **Conversation ID** | The conversation ID associated with the ticket. Enter the `{{event.conversationId}}` variable to use the current conversation's ID. |

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Done! HITL will begin whenever the **Start HITL** card executes.
</Check>

## Respond to users

Now that you've set up HITL, you can assign someone in your Workspace to respond to users.

<Note>
  This guide shows you how respond to users with the official Botpress HITL integration. However, you can also use a compatible third-party integration like [Zendesk](./zendesk).

  <Step title="Publish and test your bot">

    First, let's simulate a user escalation.

    <Warning>
      HITL won't work in the Emulator â€” you'll need to test it using Webchat.
    </Warning>

    1. Publish your bot and open the Webchat preview window.
    2. Chat with your bot until it begins HITL:
    
    ![HITL test](./assets/hitl-test.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign the conversation">
    1. Navigate to your Dashboard, then select **Human-in-the-loop** under your bot's navigation bar.
    2. Select the conversation you just started:

      ![HITL ticket](./assets/hitl-ticket.png)
    
    This will open the conversation with the user. From here, you can either assign the conversation to yourself or to another member in your Workspace.

    3. Try assigning the conversation to yourself. Select **Assign to me**:

    ![Assign HITL](./assets/hitl-assign.png)

    Now you can chat directly with the user:

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Done! Now you can chat with your users directly using HITL.
