The official LinkedIn integration allows your bot to create and delete posts from your LinkedIn account.

## Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic configuration">
    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/signup)
    </Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Search for the **LinkedIn** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        In the **Configuration** menu, select **Authorize LinkedIn**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Follow the on-screen instructions to connect Botpress to your LinkedIn account.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      When using this configuration mode, a Botpress-managed LinkedIn application connects to your LinkedIn account. Actions taken by the bot will be attributed to the LinkedIn account that authorized the connection.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual configuration">

    For advanced use cases, you can manually configure the integration using your own LinkedIn application and OAuth credentials.

    <Info>
      You will need:

      - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
      - A [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/signup)
      - A [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852) associated with your app
    </Info>

    ### Step 1: Create a LinkedIn application

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) and select **Create app**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Fill in the required fields:
        - **App name**
        - **LinkedIn Page**
        - **App logo**
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Select **Create app**.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 2: Configure OAuth settings

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        In your LinkedIn application settings, navigate to the **Products** tab.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Request access to the following products:
        - **Share on LinkedIn** — required for posting content
        - **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** — required for authentication

        <Note>
          Approval may require review by LinkedIn.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Navigate to the **Auth** tab.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Under **OAuth 2.0 settings**, add the following redirect URL:

        ```
        https://webhook.botpress.cloud/oauth
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — you'll need them to configure the integration in Botpress.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 3: Obtain an authorization code

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Construct the authorization URL by replacing `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in the following URL with your actual Client ID:

        ```
        https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://webhook.botpress.cloud/oauth&scope=openid%20profile%20email%20w_member_social&state=manual
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Visit this URL in your browser while logged into the LinkedIn account you want to use with the integration.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the application.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        You will be redirected to `webhook.botpress.cloud`. Do not close this page.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Copy the **authorization code** from the URL in your browser's address bar.

        <Note>
          The authorization code is the string that appears after `code=` in the URL.
        </Note>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 4: Configure the integration in Botpress

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Search for the **LinkedIn** integration, then select **Install Integration**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        In the **Configuration** menu, select the drop-down and choose **Manual**.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Fill in the integration's configuration fields:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Client ID">
        Paste the Client ID you copied from the **Auth** tab in the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Client Secret">
        Paste the Client Secret you copied from the **Auth** tab in the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Authorization Code">
        Paste the authorization code you obtained in [Step 3](#step-3-obtain-an-authorization-code).

        <Warning>
          The authorization code is only valid for a short period of time. If the code has expired, repeat [Step 3](#step-3-obtain-an-authorization-code) to obtain a new one.
        </Warning>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    When you've filled in all the fields, select **Save Configuration**.

    <Check>
      Your LinkedIn integration has been manually configured and is ready to use.
