The official Mintlify integration allows your bot to create and manage [Mintlify agent](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/ai/agent) jobs.

## Setup

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A [published bot](/learn/get-started/quick-start)
  - A [Mintlify account](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/signup) with a [Pro or Custom plan](https://www.mintlify.com/pricing)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the integration in Botpress">
    First, install the integration to your bot:

    1. In Botpress Studio, select **Explore Hub** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Search for the **Mintlify** integration, then select **Install Integration**.

    In the **Configuration** menu, you should see two fields:

    - **API key**
    - **Project ID**

    Leave these empty for nowâ€”you'll come back to them after getting your Mintlify credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Mintlify credentials">
    Next, get your Mintlify API key and project ID:

    1. [Log in to your Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login).
    2. In the left sidebar, go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
    3. Copy and store your **Project ID**.
    4. Select **+ Create Admin API Key**, then copy the generated API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the integration in Botpress">
    Now, you can finish setting up the integration in Botpress:

    1. In the integration's **API Key** field, paste your Mintlify API key.
    2. In the integration's **Project ID** field, paste your Mintlify project ID.
    2. Select **Save Configuration**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Your integration is ready. You can use the integration's [Cards](#cards) to interact with your Mintlify agent jobs.
