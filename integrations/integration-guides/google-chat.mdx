- Via API calls from your custom code

### Receiving Messages

The bot automatically receives and processes messages sent in the Google Chat space. It will:
- Parse incoming messages
- Process them through your Botpress flows
- Send appropriate responses back to the space

### Message Format

The integration supports text messages in Google Chat spaces. Messages can include:
- Plain text
- Basic formatting
- Links
- Mentions

## Security Considerations

- Keep your service account key secure and never share it publicly
- Regularly rotate your service account keys
- Use the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to your service account
- Monitor your bot's activity and set up appropriate logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not responding**
   - Verify the service account has the correct permissions
   - Check if the bot is properly added to the space
   - Ensure the integration is properly configured in Botpress

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify the service account JSON is correctly formatted
   - Check if the service account key is valid and not expired
   - Ensure the service account has the necessary API scopes enabled

3. **Message delivery issues**
   - Verify the space ID is correct
   - Check if the bot has permission to post in the space
   - Ensure the message format is valid
