## Overview

Here's a breakdown of how WhatsApp treats data it receives from Botpress:

| Botpress Type       | WhatsApp Type                                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `text`              | [Text Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#text-object)     |
| `text` with Markdown | [Text Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#text-object)     |
| `image`             | [Media Image Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object) |
| `audio`             | [Media Audio Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object) |
| `video`             | [Media Video Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object) |
| `file`              | [Media File Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object)   |
| `location`          | [Location Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#location-object)  |

Some data types have restrictions in WhatsApp:

## Choices

[Choices](https://botpress.com/docs/capture-information) in Botpress are mapped to [Interactive Objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#interactive-object) of the type `list` in WhatsApp.

WhatsApp renders choices differently depending on how many choices you specify in Botpress:

| Amount of Choices in Botpress | How They're Rendered in WhatsApp  |
| :---------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| 1-3                           | Buttons                          |
| 4-10                          | Dropdown                        |
| 11 or More                    | Multiple dropdowns (up to 10 choices each) |

### Labels

In WhatsApp, choices require a label. Since Botpress Studio doesn't currently support labels for choice Cards, WhatsApp uses *“Choose…”* by default.

### Character Limit

In WhatsApp:

- Button titles are limited to 19 characters
- Dropdown choice titles are limited to 23 characters

If a title exceeds the limit, WhatsApp will automatically shorten it:

{/* vale Vale.Spelling = NO */}
| Title in Botpress              | WhatsApp Button           | WhatsApp Dropdown           |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------- |
| "This is a title in Botpress" | "This is a title in ..." | "This is a title in Botp..." |
{/* vale Vale.Spelling = YES */}

## Cards

[Cards](https://botpress.com/docs/capture-information) in Botpress are mapped to [Interactive Objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#interactive-object) of the type `list` in WhatsApp.

### Links

WhatsApp only supports one link (label and URL) on a Card. If your Botpress Card has multiple links, WhatsApp will split them into multiple empty Cards.

### Reply Button

WhatsApp only supports 3 "reply" action buttons on a Card. If your Botpress Card has more than three of these buttons, WhatsApp will split them into multiple Cards.

---

## Stickers

WhatsApp will treat an image as a [Sticker](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/messages/sticker-messages) if it meets the following conditions:

- The image is in WebP format
- The image is **exactly** 512x512 in size
- The image is less than 512kb

If the image doesn't meet these conditions, the message won't be sent and a warning will be emitted.

---

## Files

When sending a file to WhatsApp, the file's name will be changed to whatever is specific in the **Title** field of the [Send Message Card](/learn/reference/cards/send-messages#file).


If you leave **Title** field blank, the file will be renamed with a generic name ("file") before being sent to WhatsApp. The WhatsApp message will still display the original file's name below the file itself.

<Note>
    You can also set a custom file name by sending the file using an [Execute Code Card](/learn/reference/cards/execute-code) and specifying a value for the `filename` attribute.
</Note>

## Carousels

WhatsApp doesn't natively support Carousels. If the bot sends a Carousel, WhatsApp will display each of its Cards in separate messages.
