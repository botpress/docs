<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    title="Not receiving messages from bot on WhatsApp"
  >
    Until Meta has verified your business, your bot won't be able to send messages to WhatsApp users, even if you've configured it correctly.

    If you need to test out your bot right away, you can use the [WhatsApp Playground](#playground) while waiting for business verification.
