## Cards

<Warning>
  Some of the integration's Cards use [WhatsApp message templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/) to send messages to users.

  In WhatsApp, these templates support both [named and positional parameters](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/#parameter-formats). However, the integration currently only supports positional parameters. This means you'll get an error if you try to provide named parameters in a Card's `conversation.templateVariablesJson` field.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    title="Not receiving messages from bot on WhatsApp"
  >
    Until Meta has verified your business, your bot won't be able to send messages to WhatsApp users, even if you've configured it correctly.

    If you need to test out your bot right away, you can use the [WhatsApp Playground](#playground) while waiting for business verification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Meta business verification taking too long"
  >
    Unfortunately, we can't help speed up Meta's business verification process.

    If you need to test out your bot right away, you can use the [WhatsApp Playground](#playground) while waiting for business verification.
