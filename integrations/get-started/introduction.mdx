Integrations allow you to **connect your bot** to external services, APIs, and tools.

You can explore any available integrations on [Botpress Hub](/integrations/get-started/botpress-hub), which includes integrations built by both Botpress and by users.

<Note>
  Want to build your own integration and publish it on [Botpress Hub](/integrations/get-started/botpress-hub)? Check out our [integrations SDK](/integrations/sdk/integration/getting-started).
