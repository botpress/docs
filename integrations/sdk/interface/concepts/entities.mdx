title: Generic Entities
---

## Overview

Entities define **standardized data structures** for an interface.

Once an interface defines entities, its actions and events can consume or produce instances of those entities. Plugins can also define a dependency on specific interfaces, then consume entities produced by integrations that implement those interfaces.

Integrations that implement an interface can:

- Rename entities to align with the terminology of external services
- Extend entities with extra fields to meet the specific needs of the external service.

## Example: `listable` interface

Consider a `listable` interface designed to provide standardized listing functionality across different services:

### Interface Definition
- Defines an `item` entity as a base structure for `listable` resources
- Specifies a `listItems` action that returns `item` results

### GitHub integration implementation
An integration connecting to GitHub might implement this interface as follows:

- Extends the `item` entity to create a `pullRequest` entity with GitHub-specific fields
- Renames the `listItems` action to `listPullRequests` to reflect GitHub terminology
- Implements the required functionality while using terminology that makes sense for GitHub

### Slack integration implementation
A Slack integration might implement the same interface differently:

- Extends the `item` entity to create a `channel` entity with Slack-specific properties
- Renames the `listItems` action to `listChannels` to reflect Slack terminology
- Provides the same core capability but adapted to Slack's specific requirements
