# Build confidence

Botpress is a powerful, customizable platform â€” this means no single user will have exactly the same needs when building a bot.

Our how-to guides are great for learning common use-cases and troubleshooting issues. However, they won't necessarily walk you through every step of _your own process_ â€” and that's okay! We want to help you build confidence to experiment, so you can build bots that behave exactly how you want.

# Cross-reference

As you become more familiar with Botpress, you may have ideas or questions that aren't covered in this section. We recommend cross-referencing with the [Dashboard](https://botpress.com/docs/workspace) and [Studio](https://botpress.com/docs/interface) sections to gain a better understanding of the platform.
