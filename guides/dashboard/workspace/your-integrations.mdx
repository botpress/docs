About the Botpress Hub

The Botpress Hub is a public repository of integrations you can use to extend your Botpress bot's functionalities and options for deployment.

It is open to the public, so you can make contributions to it, share integrations with colleagues or bot builders across the world, and download integrations developed by Botpress and other builders.

Consult the [Botpress Hub documentation](/guides/studio/interface/card-hub) to learn more.

From this tab, you can keep track of all integrations your Workspace currently owns and manages. You can manage the privacy of the integration, view detailed logs and settings, and keep track of previous versions.
