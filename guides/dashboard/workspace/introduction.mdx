In Botpress, a workspace is an environment where you can organize, manage, and collaborate on multiple bot projects. It allows teams to collaborate effectively by sharing access to these resources in a defined space.

Each Workspace can contain multiple bots, so you can keep them organized by client, department, or other specific use case. Within a Workspace, you can manage permissions, track integrations, and monitor analytics.

<Note>
Workspaces are the billing unit on Botpress

Add-ons purchased by PAYG and Team plan users are distributed at the Workspace level, meaning that they only apply to the bots living in the Workspace in which those add-ons are purchased.

Various Workspaces in a single account can subscribe to different plans and add-ons.
