## Billing

From the Billing menu, you can see an overview of your next upcoming payment, your current AI Spend limit, and retrieve any invoices or details about your payment information.

You will also see an overview of your current plan, and can compare or make changes to this plan.

PAYG and Team plan customers can also make amendments to their subscription, including purchasing or removing add-ons.

### Billing FAQs

#### I've changed my subscription but the changes do not appear reflected in my dashboard?

Because subscriptions are active throughout an entire month (or billing cycle), changes made to your subscription will appear when the next billing cycle begins.

The Billing page in your dashboard displays next month's subscription, so you can see when your changes will take effect.

#### If I purchase a plan or subscription upgrade in the middle of the month, when will I get charged?

Upgrades to your subscription are immediately pro-rated. If you purchase a Team plan in the middle of the month, you will pay half the value of the Team plan (for the remainder of that month), and then you will be billed as normal starting the 1st of the following month.

#### Where can I find Botpress invoices?

You can access invoices by clicking on the 'View invoices and payment information' link in the Billing menu.

#### Where can I add my Tax ID?

You can add your Tax ID by clicking on the 'View invoices and payment information' link in the Billing menu.

#### Where can I change which email receives receipts and invoices?
