Once you [publish and share your bot](/guides/getting-started), you can use the Conversations tab to view and manage your bot's interactions with users. This means you can:

* View user messages and replies
* Identify and fix issues with your bot
* Improve your user experience

## Features

### Listing conversations

This menu lists each conversation your bot has had, sorted by the conversation's most recent message. It provides the conversation ID, a unique identifier for each conversation, as well as an AI-generated summary of the conversation.

You can click the conversation ID to navigate to the specific conversation and view it in greater detail.

When viewing a conversation, you can click on any message to inspect its properties, like the time at which it was sent, a unique message ID, and the JSON for that specific message.
