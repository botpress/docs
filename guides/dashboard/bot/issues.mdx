This tab lists any issues present in your bot's interactions with users.

The information in this tab complements the information found in the [Logs](doc:logs) and the [Events](doc:events) tabs by providing information about persistent, repeatable errors. This includes, for example, errors thrown in execute code cards, but will not diagnose problems like AI hallucinations or inconsistent responses.

Issues listed in this tab are grouped by error type. Inspecting a specific issue will show you a list of all the times that event has occurred. Further inspecting each individual event allows you to see detailed information about the issue, like the payload, user and conversation IDs, and the channel or integration on which it occurred.

The Issues tab is a critical feature for monitoring and improving the quality and reliability of your bot. It serves as a centralized hub for identifying, tracking, and resolving problems or errors that occur during chatbot interactions. It's essential for maintaining the operational integrity of your bot, ensuring that problems are quickly identified and resolved.
