Using the Analytics tab in your bot's dashboard, you can visualize your bot's recent activity as well as monitor the health of your chatbot project.

## Default Layout

By default, each bot in your Workspace comes with pre-configured analytics charts. These cover last month's users, new or returning users, how many messages users send per session, how many sessions your bot had over the last month, how many messages were sent to your bot over the last month, and a general overview of the previous 3 months.

## Custom Boards

You can create custom boards, which visualize data related to your bot, by either editing an existing board from your default layout or creating a new chart altogether.

## Time Period

When customizing a board, you can select from a list of pre-configured time periods to determine which time period's data gets visualized in your Analytics tab. Each of the boards in this tab can display information from different time periods.

## Event Types

When choosing what data your Analytics tab will display, you can choose from a list of conversation-related events. These include:

* total, new, and returning users
* sessions
* bot, user, and total messages
* average messages sent by your bot per session
* average messages sent by users per session
* average number of sessions per user
* the custom botready, botpulished, state\_expired, and conversationStarted events.

## Chart Types

You can visualize data in the analytics tab with the following charts: area, donut, bar, pie, metric, spark bar, and spark area.
