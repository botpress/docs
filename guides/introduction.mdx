Botpress is an all-in-one platform for building AI agents powered by the latest LLMs. Whether you're just getting started or need help with a specific issue, the Botpress documentation is the best place to learn the platform.

<Warning>
Under construction

We're currently rebuilding the Botpress documentation from the ground up, so it's even easier to find the help you need!

Be sure to check in regularly for updates, new guides, and improved content. You can also leave us feedback at the bottom of any page, or [send us an email](mailto:docs@botpress.com) with your thoughts.

# Quick Start

The [Quick Start guide](/guides/botpress-quickstart) teaches you to build, test, and deploy your first bot. This section is great for beginners who aren't yet familiar with the Botpress interface, and want to learn to create a bot from A to Z.

# Learn by Doing

We believe the best way to learn Botpress is to *start using it*. Once you've finished Quick Start and deployed your first bot, check out the [Learn](/guides/learn-by-doing) section and follow our detailed how-to guides.

<Note>
Build confidence

Botpress is a powerful, customizable platform — this means no single user will have exactly the same needs when building a bot.

Our how-to guides are great for learning common use-cases and troubleshooting issues. However, they won't necessarily walk you through every step of *your own process* — and that's okay! We want to help you build confidence to experiment, so you can build bots that behave exactly how you want.

# Reference

Once you've gained some familiarity with Botpress, you'll likely have questions about the interface and specific features. For detailed explanations on everything Botpress, check out the [Dashboard](/guides/workspace) or [Studio](/guides/interface) sections.
