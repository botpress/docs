# Prerequisites

* A [Trello account](https://trello.com/)
* A board in Trello, with at least one list
* The ID of the list where cards will be created. Refer to [this article](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello-questions/How-do-I-find-the-LIST-ID/qaq-p/2272862) to locate it.
* A [Botpress Cloud account](https://sso.botpress.cloud) and a [Botpress Bot](/guides/getting-started)

# Setting up the Trello integration in Botpress

1. Go to the [Integration Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub) in Botpress Cloud (if you don't have the integration installed yet).
