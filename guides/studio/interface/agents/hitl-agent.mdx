description: Allows human intervention in the bot's conversations and decision-making.
---

The HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Agent allows human intervention in the bot’s conversations and decision-making. This is particularly useful in complex scenarios where the bot might need confirmation or input from a human operator.

# Configuration

## Escalation Integration

This is the integration you will use to handle the escalation.

You can enable HITL with a prebuilt integration, or build a custom integration if you're using a third-party customer support provider that is not listed here:

| Integrations that support HITL |
| :----------------------------- |
| ZenDesk                        |
| HITL (Botpress)                |

## Queue Timeout

This is the maximum wait time the bot will wait for an agent to handle the user's query. This time is set in minutes. If this timeout limit is reached, the bot will continue on with its conversational flow.

## Intent to cancel HITL

This option allows the user to cancel their request to speak to a human agent.

The intents can be created and configured through the Library in the Studio.

## Transcript Context

This is what the bot will send to the human agent as additional context for the user's request. The default information includes the channel and integration on which the user was having the conversation, as well as both the Summary and Transcript variables generated by the Summary Agent.

You can customize this to include whatever pieces of information are necessary for your specific scenario. This field supports variable expressions.

## HITL Messages

In these sections, you can customize what message your bot sends in various steps of the HITL process. These include:

* while the end user is waiting to speak to an agent
* when an agent is assigned to an end user
* when the human agent ends the interaction
* when the end user cancels the request
* when the agent request times out

# Exposed Variables

```
{{conversation.HITLAgent.isHitl}}

{{conversation.HITLAgent.hitlSessionStatus}}
