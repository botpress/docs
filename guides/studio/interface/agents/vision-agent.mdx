The Vision Agent adds image recognition and visual processing capabilities to the bot. It allows the bot to analyze and interpret visual data, such as images, screenshots, or camera feeds.

# Configuration

## Extract from Incoming Images

When this option is enabled, the bot will attempt to extract any text content from an image. It will also produce a description of the image itself.

The Vision Agent will save any extracted content and descriptions to the variable it exposes.

# Exposed Variables

The Vision Agent exposes one variable for use:

```
{{turn.Visionagent.content}}
```
