Agents are specialized modules or components that extend the capabilities of a bot beyond its basic functions. These agents are designed to perform specific tasks or processes that enhance the bot's ability to interact with users, retrieve information, or manage conversations more effectively.

Botpress offers a variety of specialized Agents to enhance your bot's capabilities and functions. These Agents are designed to perform specific tasks, each contributing to the overall performance of your chatbot. Here, we introduce five of our agents: HITL, Summary, Personality, Knowledge, and Translator Agents.
