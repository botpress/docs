The Policy Agent is designed to enforce business rules, compliance guidelines, or specific operational policies during bot interactions. It ensures that the bot adheres to legal, regulatory, or company-specific policies that you designate.

# Configuration

## Policy Description

In this field, you can describe the policies to which you want your bot to adhere.

If there are certain off-brand words that your bot should stay away from when generating responses, or you'd like your bot to avoid providing information about competitors' products or services, you can indicate that here.

## Model

This is the model used to influence and generate responses in accordance with the Policy Description.

## Additional Information

The Policy Agent is a powerful tool that enhances the safety and control of LLM-driven interactions by enforcing constraints and managing compliance across your bot's conversations. As organizations increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, maintaining control over these systems is paramount. The Policy Agent acts as a safeguard, ensuring that all bot interactions remain within the defined boundaries of your business rules, regulatory standards, and operational policies. This not only helps protect your brand but also instills confidence in your organization's use of AI technology.

One of the critical challenges with LLMs  is the risk of generating responses that may be off-brand, inaccurate, or non-compliant—often referred to as "hallucinations." These hallucinations can lead to misleading or incorrect information being provided to users. The Policy Agent directly addresses this risk by functioning as a gatekeeper, filtering and controlling the responses generated by your AI. By configuring specific constraints, such as banned words, sensitive topics, or off-limits information, the Policy Agent ensures that the output remains aligned with your organization’s guidelines, protecting both your reputation and legal standing.

The Policy Agent also introduces control mechanisms that act as gates for bot behaviour. These gates serve as checkpoints, ensuring that every interaction complies with designated business rules before it reaches the end user. This control extends to the specific contexts in which your AI operates, allowing it to adapt to various business needs while maintaining stringent adherence to predefined policies. Whether it's preventing the bot from discussing competitor products or controlling language to avoid sensitive terms, the Policy Agent’s gates provide a reliable framework to keep LLMs operating safely within set parameters.

By integrating constraints directly into the model, the Policy Agent not only enhances compliance but also minimizes the likelihood of unwanted behaviours. These constraints act as a foundational control layer, enabling decision-makers to trust that Botpress bots will behave predictably and within the bounds of their company’s standards. The end result is a robust, reliable system that not only enhances the operational capabilities of your bots but also significantly reduces the risk of regulatory non-compliance and brand-damaging missteps.

The Policy Agent provides a comprehensive solution for controlling LLM-driven interactions, ensuring that your organization’s use of AI remains safe, compliant, and within the bounds of designated rules. By implementing constraints, gates, and robust control measures, it acts as a critical safeguard, making it an essential tool for any business aiming to leverage AI while maintaining strict adherence to its policies.
