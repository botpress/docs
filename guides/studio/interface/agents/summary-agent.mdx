The Summary Agent condenses lengthy or complex pieces of information gathered throughout a conversation into shorter, digestible summaries. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need a quick understanding of a conversation or interaction's context without going through all the details.

# Configuration

## Summary Max Tokens

This is the maximum length of the AI-generated summary, measured in tokens.

## Transcript Max Lines

This is the maximum length of the conversation transcript that the agent will record to the Conversation Transcript variable.

## Model

This is the model used to generate the summary that can be accessed through the Conversation Summary variable.

## Exposed Variables

The Summary Agent exposes two variables:

### Conversation Summary

```
{{conversation.SummaryAgent.summary}}
```

The Conversation Summary variable stores an AI-generated summary of the conversation up to the point at which it is accessed.

### Conversation Transcript

```
{{conversation.SummaryAgent.transcript}}
```

The Conversation Transcript variable stores an exact transcript of the conversation up to the point at which it is accessed.
