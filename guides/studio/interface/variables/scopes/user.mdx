title: User variables
---

User variables let you store and reuse information within the scope of **a single user**.

Any information you assign to a user variable will follow the user across multiple conversations with your bot. This makes user variables great for storing user-specific information, like:

- Personal details
- User preferences
- Notes from previous conversations

<Note>
    If you don't want your variable to follow the user between conversations, use a different [variable scope](/guides/studio/interface/variables/overview#variable-scopes).

## Read a user variable

You can use `{{user.variablename}}` or `@user.variablename` to read a user variable. For example, in a **Text** Card:
