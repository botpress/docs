Variables let you **store information** from somewhere in Botpress Studio and **reuse it somewhere else**.

<Tip>
Think of a variable like an **empty box**. You can fill it with any kind of information you want — like a name, a number, or a preference — and put it away for safekeeping. Then, when your bot needs that information again, it can open the box and access what's inside.
</Tip>

## Variable scopes

You can use different types of variables to **scope** the information you store. For example, you might want some information to:

- [Follow a user across all their conversations](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variable-scopes/user) (for example, their name and address)
- [Persist only throughout a single conversation](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variable-scopes/conversation) (for example, items in a virtual shopping cart)
- [Be safely accessible across all your bot's activity](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variable-scopes/configuration) (for example, API tokens and other secrets)

Select any variable scope to learn more about it:

## Data types for variables

Botpress variables are **typed**, meaning they are limited in what data they can hold. These data types are important to:

- Ensure the code behind Botpress runs smoothly
- Help AI tasks generate better results

Here are the different data types available for Botpress variables:

<Accordion title="Data types for variables">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Type
      </th>

      <th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        String
      </td>

      <td>
        Values that are treated as text. Strings can contain any amount of letters, numbers, or special characters. <br/> <br/> Example uses: Storing a user's name, storing an AI task's generated message.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Boolean
      </td>

      <td>
        Variables can be true or false, with a lowercase 't' or 'f'. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing if a user is a returning customer, storing whether the bot has greeted the user or not
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Number
      </td>

      <td>
        Variables that are numeric, either with or without decimal places. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing a user's phone number, storing an address's area code
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Date
      </td>

      <td>
        Variables that are a single date or date and time. Botpress uses ISO 8601 date/time format, such as `20220921T10:34:14` for `21 September 2023 at 10:34 AM` (with 14 seconds). <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing when the user starts a chat, storing a user's appointment date

    <tr>
      <td>
        Object
      </td>

      <td>

## Special variables

Botpress makes available several different variables that can be used in your bot's code. These variables are useful for debugging and for accessing information about the user and conversation.

## Pass variables between Workflows

You can pass variables between Workflows in Botpress Studio. This is useful if you want to use a previously created variable within the scope of a single Workflow. For example:

- You want to collect user information in one Workflow, then validate it in a sub-Workflow.
- You have a Workflow that stores items in a virtual shopping cart, and you want to process payment for those items in a sub-Workflow.
- You have some condition in one Workflow, and you want a sub-Workflow to behave differently based on that condition.

To pass variables between Workflows:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Setup your input variable">
    1. In your sub-Workflow (the one you want to pass the variable to), [create a new Workflow variable](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variable-scopes/workflow).

    <Note>
      You can pass any kind of variable from your parent Workflow, but your sub-Workflow needs to treat it as a Workflow variable.
    </Note>

    2. Select the Entry Node of your sub-Workflow, then select the variable you just created:
    
    ![Toggle input variable](/guides/studio/interface/variables/toggle-input-variable.png)

    This tells the parent Workflow that your sub-Workflow is expecting some input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass the variable to the sub-Workflow">
    In your parent Workflow, select the Card that transitions to the sub-Workflow. It should display the input variable you just created:

    ![Input variable field](/guides/stuudio/interface/variables/input-variable-field.png)

    You can manually enter a value to pass to the sub-Workflow, or use a previously created variable from your parent Workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Now, whatever value you pass from your parent Workflow will be available in your sub-Workflow as a Workflow variable.
</Check>

## Use variables in an Execute Code Card

Variables in code follow the pattern `variabletype.variablename`. Here's a breakdown and examples of how to use these:

### 1. Assigning a Value to a Variable

This is typically how you'd initialize a variable or change its value.

```javascript
workflow.orderNumber = 12345
session.cartTotal = 59.99
user.lastName = 'Smith'
bot.version = '1.2.3'
env.databaseURL = 'https://example.com/db'
```

### 2. Using Variables in Conditional Statements

This checks the value of a variable and executes code accordingly.

```javascript
if (user.firstName === 'John') {
  console.log('Hello John!')
} else {
  console.log('Welcome, user!')
}
```

### 3. Using Variables in Functions

Here, you might pass a variable as a function argument or use it inside a function.

```javascript
function greetUser(firstName) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + firstName + '!')
}

greetUser(user.firstName)
```

### 4. Combining Variables

You might want to combine or concatenate variables.

```javascript
var fullName = user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName

//or

var welcomeMessage = 'Hello, ' + user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName + '!'
```

### 5. Checking Variable Type

Botpress might throw an error if types don't match, you can use type checking before assigning values.

```javascript
if (typeof workflow.userAcctId === 'number') {
  workflow.userAcctId = 67890 // This is okay.
} else {
  console.error('Invalid type for userAcctId!')
}
```

### 6. Using Variables with External APIs

If your bot interacts with external services, you might use an environment variable like env.apiKey.

```javascript
const apiKey = env.API_KEY
const apiUrl = env.API_URL

const config = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  },
}

const response = await axios.get(apiUrl, config)
const data = response.data

// Process the data as needed
// ...

// Example: Log the response data
console.log(data)
```                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
