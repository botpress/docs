title: Conversation variables
---

Conversation variables let you store and reuse information within the scope of **a single conversation**.

Conversation variables are great for storing information that's only relevant to the current conversation, but that you need to access in multiple Workflows. For example:

- Items in a virtual shopping cart
- Conversation-specific preferences
- A checklist to track the completion of sub-Workflows

<Note>
Information stored in conversation variables is deleted when the current conversation is over. If you need a variable to persist across multiple conversations, use a different [variable scope](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variables#variable-scopes).

## Create a conversation variable
â€‹
To create a conversation variable:

1. Open any Workflow.
2. Select **+** in the **Variables** section at the bottom of the left navigation bar.
3. Choose a **Type** and **Name** for your variable:

![Conversation variable](/guides/studio/interface/variables/conversation-variable.png)

## Read your variable

Once you've created your variable, you can use `{{conversation.variablename}}` or `@conversation.variablename` to read it. For example, in a **Text** Card:
