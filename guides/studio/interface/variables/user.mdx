User variables let you store and reuse information within the scope of **a single user**.

Any information you assign to a user variable will follow the user across multiple conversations with your bot. This makes user variables great for storing user-specific information, like:

- Personal details
- User preferences
- Notes from previous conversations

<Note>
    If you don't want your variable to follow the user between conversations, use a different [variable scope](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variables#variable-scopes).

## Create a user variable
â€‹
To create a user variable:

1. Open any Workflow.
2. Select **+** in the **Variables** section at the bottom of the left navigation bar.
3. Choose a **Type** and **Name** for your variable:

![User variable](/guides/studio/interface/variables/user-variable.png)

## Read your variable

Once you've created your variable, you can use `{{user.variablename}}` or `@user.variablename` to read it. For example, in a **Text** Card:
