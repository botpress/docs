title: Workflow variables
---

Workflow variables let you store and reuse information within the scope of **a single [Workflow](/guides/studio/interface/studio-interface-flows)**. They're great for:

- Storing an AI task's output
- Saving and reusing user input
- Organizing data returned from an API call

<Note>
Workflow variables are only accessible in the Workflow they were created in. If you need a variable to be accessible in multiple Workflows, use a different [variable scope](/guides/studio/interface/variables/variables#variable-scopes).

## Create a Workflow variable

To create a Workflow variable:

1. Open any Workflow.
2. Select **+** in the **Variables** section at the bottom of the left navigation bar.
3. Choose a **Type** and **Name** for your variable:

![Workflow variable](/guides/studio/interface/variables/workflow-variable.png)

## Read your variable

Once you've created your variable, you can use `{{workflow.variablename}}` or `@workflow.variablename` to read it. For example, in a **Text** Card:
