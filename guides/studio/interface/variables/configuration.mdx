Configuration variables let you **securely store information throughout your bot**.

Like with [bot variables](/guides/studio/interface/variables/bot.mdx), configuration variables are accessible across all Workflows and conversations. The key difference is that configuration variables are **encrypted**. This means an Autonomous Node cannot read or display information you store in a configuration variable.

This extra layer of security makes configuration variables great for storing sensitive information, like:

- API Tokens
- Private IP Addresses
- Usernames and passwords

<Note>
    If you need your variable to be available globally but don't need/want to store it securely, use a [bot variable](/guides/studio/interface/variables/bot).

## Create a configuration variable

To create a configuration variable:

3. Select **+**, then enter a **Name** and **Value** for your variable:

## Read your variable

Once you've created your variable, you can use `env.variablename` to read it. For example, in an [Execute Code](/guides/studio/cards/execute) Card:
