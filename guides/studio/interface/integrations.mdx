Integrations extend the capabilities of your bots by connecting them with external services, APIs, and tools. They allow your bots to fetch data, trigger actions, interact with third-party platforms, and provide more dynamic and powerful user experiences. They can send and receive data from other tools, or they can be used to deploy your bot on alternative messaging channels.

# Using Integrations

## Search

To find integrations, navigate to the integrations icon in the left-hand menu of the Studio, indicated by a puzzle icon.

You can search for integrations to third-party services by name here, like WhatsApp or Messenger.

## Install

Clicking on an integration from a search result will open a menu that allows you to install that integration to your bot. From this menu, you can also see information like prerequisites, installation instructions, and the Botpress user responsible for contributing the integration to the hub.

> âœ… Verification
>
> Integrations with a checkmark icon next to the name have been verified and confirmed as trusted integrations for safety and function by the Botpress team.

## Configure

Once you've installed an integration to your bot, you can proceed with any necessary configuration steps. This can include providing API keys, inputting data, or completing third-party setup wizards.

## Usage

Once you've installed and configured an integration to your bot, you can start using it.

For integrations that deploy your bot to a messaging channel like WhatsApp or Telegram, after you've configured the integration and published your bot, it will start sending and receiving messages on those channels.

For integrations that enhance your bot's functionalities, like connecting to a third-party tool, you will find additional cards in the Card Tray that enable certain integration actions. Refer to the documentation for the integration you are using for detailed instructions.
