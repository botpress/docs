In the Flows panel, each flow represents a specific part of the conversation logic or interaction path the bot will follow when handling a conversation or performing a task. Each flow represents a unique interaction pathway, determining how the bot responds to specific user inputs and scenarios. By configuring these flows, you can control the bot's behaviour, ensuring it provides a consistent and user-friendly experience across various situations.

# Flows in the menu

## Main

The "Main" flow is the primary conversation flow that your bot follows during standard interactions. It is the default pathway that guides the user through the core functionalities of the bot. This flow should be configured to handle general queries, initial greetings, intent recognition, and primary navigation through the bot's features. Set up the main flow to start when the bot is initiated and guide the user through typical use cases or services provided by the bot.

## Error

The "Error" flow is triggered when the bot encounters a problem, such as an unrecognized command, invalid input, or a processing failure. Configure this flow to manage unexpected situations gracefully. The bot should inform the user of the error and offer options for recovery, such as retrying the action or redirecting to the main flow. Include helpful error messages and potential solutions to guide the user back to a valid conversation path.

## Timeout

The "Timeout" flow is activated when there is a prolonged period of inactivity from the user. This flow handles idle sessions by either prompting the user or ending the conversation. Use this flow to re-engage the user after a period of silence or to gracefully conclude the conversation if the user is unresponsive. Set a timeout duration and specify actions such as sending a reminder message, asking if the user needs more help, or automatically closing the session.

## Conversation End

The "Conversation End" flow manages how the bot concludes interactions. This includes wrapping up the conversation, providing summaries, or offering follow-up actions. Configure this flow to ensure the conversation ends positively. The bot might thank the user, provide a summary of the conversation, or suggest next steps. Include a polite closing message, potential follow-up options like a survey or re-engagement link, and any necessary final actions.
