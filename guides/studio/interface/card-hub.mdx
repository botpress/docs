From the Hub, you can download and install prebuilt workflows or integrations for use within your bots. The Hub is designed to save time and enhance your development by providing access to workflows and integrations created by Botpress, your team, or other bot builders in the community.

Cards and integrations are accessible through the Hub, a centralized library where you can browse and select assets to add directly to your projects. Whether you're integrating common functions like user authentication, setting up a third-party service like a CRM or analytics provider, or implementing complex interactions like a multi-step booking flow, the Hub makes it easy to find and deploy what you need.

# Accessing the Hub

The Hub is accessible from the top of the Studio, represented by an icon shaped like a globe.

# Installation and use

Use the search bar to look for specific functions, like 'message delay' or 'NPS survey,' or integrations with external services like 'HubSpot'.

When you've found a workflow or integration you want to install, click on the 'Install' button.

* Workflows will be added for use to your card tray
* Integrations will usually make a set of cards available in a dedicated section of your card tray.

Both workflows and integrations usually require some configuration before they can be used.

You can use a card by dragging it from the tray into a node. When the workflow reaches this card, your bot will execute the prebuilt workflow, along with any options you were prompted to configure during installation. 

For integrations, follow the prompts to configure the service as needed.

# Customizing a workflow

Right-clicking on a workflow card once you've added it to your workflow, or revisiting the installation menu from the Hub, allows you to make a copy of the Card and modify its contents.

This creates a version of the installed Card available as a workflow directly in your bot, enabling you to make any custom changes needed.

These changes will not affect the public listing of the workflow.

# Sharing workflows

To share your own workflow as a card available on the Hub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the workflow you'd like to share.
2. On the right-side panel, click 'Share Workflow.'
3. Follow the steps in this menu to make the Card public.
