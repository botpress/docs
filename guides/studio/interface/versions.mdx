Versions in Botpress help you track, manage, and control changes made to your bots.

They provide a detailed log of updates, allowing you to view past versions, compare changes, and revert to previous states if necessary. This feature is essential for collaborative bot development, ensuring transparency, accountability, and easy recovery from unintended changes.

# Accessing Versions

The Versions menu can be found on the left-hand menu by clicking on the icon that looks like a clock.

# Creating a new Version

Versions are created in two ways:

1. By clicking on the '+' in the Versions menu and manually creating a new Version
2. Automatically, every time you publish your bot

It's a good idea to annotate every saved Version you have and indicate any of the major changes or updates made.

# Reverting to a previous Version

From the Versions menu, you can revert to a previous version by clicking into it and restoring to a previous Version. Note that reverting to a previous version will completely overwrite your current bot, including any unsaved changes you may have made.

Botpress cannot restore lost or overwritten bot Versions.
