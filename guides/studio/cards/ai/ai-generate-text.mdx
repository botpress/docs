# AI Generate Text Overview

The AI Generate Text card is a specific type of AI Task that helps you generate text based on a prompt and a few settings. This is useful for countless different use cases such as:

* Generating catchy blog titles from a topic or keyword
* Summarizing long texts or documents in a few sentences
* Creating articles from bullet points or outlines
* Writing product descriptions that highlight the features and benefits
* Crafting creative content such as stories, poems, lyrics, and more!

# Using AI Generate Text

You have a few settings in the AI Generate Text card:

* Prompt: the text you want to use as a starting point for the AI to generate content, you can use variables here (like `{{event.preview}}` to get the last user message)
* Output variable: the variable where the generated text will be stored
* Advanced settings > Model: the LLM model you want to use to generate the text (the current options are GPT-3 and GPT-4)
* Advanced settings > Temperature: the higher the temperature, the more creative the text will be
* Advanced settings > Output length: the length of the generated text in tokens. Check out [this article by OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them) to learn more about LLM tokens.
