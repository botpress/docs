# Overview

The cards in the AI section of the card tray are specialized tools that leverage advanced AI capabilities, including natural language processing, data analysis, and machine learning, to enhance your bot's functionality. These cards allow your bot to perform complex tasks, such as summarizing content, translating languages, analyzing user input, and more, adding intelligence and adaptability to your conversational flows.

AI is everywhere!

In addition to these dedicated, AI-powered cards, you'll find that LLMs power almost every aspect of the Botpress conversational experience.

These cards provide you direct, task-based access to LLMs, giving you more control over their inputs and outputs.
