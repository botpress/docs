# AI Transition Overview

The AI Transition card is a specific type of AI Task that helps you classify text into a set of predefined categories. This is useful for several different cases such as assessing the user intent without needing to create training phrases, or extracting the main topic of a text.

# Using AI Transitions

You have three fields in the AI Transition card:

* Text to categorize: the text input you want to process, you can use variables here (like `{{event.preview}}` to get the last user message)
* Categories: the list of categories you want to use to classify the text.
* Store result in variable (Optional): allows you to select a variable to store the resulting category in. This is useful if you want to use the category later in the conversation.

> You can use the AI Transition card to replace Intents. You just need to create a category for each intent you want to replace, and use the AI Transition card instead of adding multiple inline or Library intents.
