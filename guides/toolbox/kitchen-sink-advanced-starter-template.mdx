## Core Functionalities

1. **Initial User Data Loading**
   - Capture platform-specific user data (Messenger ID, WhatsApp number, webchat data, etc...)
   - Handle different integration sources
     <br />
2. **Event Tracking**
   - Custom analytics platform integration
   - Support for Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Segment
   - Botpress' built-in analytics Agent.
     <br />
3. **Proactive Greeting**
   - Bot-initiated conversations (embedded webchat and shareable link only)
     <br />
4. **Workflow Routing System**
   - Using a central routing node to route to other workflows.
   - Helps solve the question "How to transition outside of an autonomous node?"
   - Two routing options:
     1. Autonomous node-based routing (AI option)
     2. Button-based routing (non-AI option)
        <br />
5. **Requiring Information from the User to Send to an External Tool**
   - Required field collection (e.g. requiring a valid email)
   - External tool to send tickets or information to
   - Botpress table integration (to send information as rows)
     <br />
6. **Querying Knowledge Base and Saving Search Results**
   - Question and answer tracking
   - Prevent AI hallucinations by telling the user that no answer was found if the information does not exist within the knowledge base. This bot covers fallback handling for unanswered questions.
   - Track the exact chunk, knowledge base, and citation for where the information came from within your knowledge base.
     <br />
7. **Live Agent Handoff**
   - Assigning a ticket to a live agent, causing the conversation with the bot to be temporarily paused until the live agent is done solving the ticket.
   - The human can "talk through" the bot to the user.
     <br />
8. **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) System**
   - End-of-conversation survey
   - Conversation summary generation and storage in Conversation Ratings Table
     <br />
9. **Table Search and Filtering**
   - Querying from a Botpress table to fetch row(s) based on user input parameters.
     <br />
10. **Management of Multiple Sub-Bots within a Single Bot for Multi-Client Purposes**
    - Client-specific knowledge base segmentation
    - Customer tag and identity management
    - Dynamic knowledge base selection
    - Multi-client support within a single bot instance
