# Overview

Ensuring the safety of AI-driven interactions is a core priority for our team, and for bot builders. The Botpress platform is designed to empower developers while maintaining strict safety standards, giving you the tools needed to build reliable and controlled AI solutions. This overview covers the key safety aspects of Botpress, including constraint management, data privacy, access control, and mitigation of AI-related risks like hallucinations.

## Key Safety Features

1. **Policy Agent**: Control AI behavior with predefined rules and constraints to ensure responses align with your organizationâ€™s standards. The Policy Agent acts as a gatekeeper, enforcing guardrails and mitigating hallucinations by filtering outputs against customizable policies.

2. **Access Control & Permissions**: Secure your environment with granular access control. Define roles and permissions to regulate who can view, edit, and deploy AI models, ensuring that only authorized users can make changes.

3. **Data Privacy & Security**: Botpress prioritizes data security with encryption, anonymization, and secure API connections. Our platform helps you comply with privacy regulations, safeguarding sensitive information across all interactions.

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**: Gain insights into AI behavior and performance through monitoring and analytics tools. Track usage patterns, detect anomalies, and adjust policies in real time to maintain optimal safety levels.

5. **Error Mitigation & Recovery**: Implement fallback mechanisms that catch errors or misbehaviors, redirecting interactions to human agents or predefined safe states. This ensures continuity and reliability even when the AI is uncertain or encounters edge cases.
