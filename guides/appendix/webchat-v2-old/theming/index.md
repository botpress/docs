The Webchat v2 is designed to be easily customizable with a lot of flexibility. You can theme the webchat in a few different ways. From the simplest to the most advanced, here are the ways you can customize the webchat:

1. **Using Botpress themes**: The easiest way to customize the webchat is to use the themes provided by Botpress. You can choose from a variety of themes that are available out of the box. You can choose a brand colour to match your website or application.

2. **Using CSS**: You can add custom CSS to further style the webchat to change the appearance of the chat UI. You can enable these changes through the webchat integration settings.

3. **Using the React library**: If you want to customize the webchat even further, you can use the [React library](../docs/webchat-react-library) to modify the Webchat components.
