Botpress Cloud allows you to create, manage, and deploy chatbots with little to no coding or infrastructure. In the natural course of maintaining a bot you may want to access its data outside of Botpress for various purposes, such as reporting, analysis, backup, or integration.

This section covers some of the most important use cases for extracting bot data to third-parties software.
