Webchat is a **custom frontend for your bot**, built by Botpress.

You can use Webchat to add your bot to your website in a variety of ways, from a simple [injection script](./inject/get-started) to a fully customizeable [React library](./webchat-components/get-started).

<Tip>
    Looking for a way to integrate your bot in your backend? Check out the [Chat API](/api-reference/chat-api/introduction).
