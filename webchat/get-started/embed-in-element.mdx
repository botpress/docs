title: Embed Webchat in an element
---


You can embed Webchat inside a specific HTML element on your website. This hides the chat bubble that usually toggles Webchat and gives you more control over Webchat's appearance and location.

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start) using Webchat v3.3
  - Basic familiarity with HTML

  <Step title="Add the element to your website">
    Next, add an element to your website's HTML. Set the `id` attribute to the ID you copied earlier:

    ```

  Done! The Webchat window will now be visible in the element.
