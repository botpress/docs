You can manually embed the Webchat window in an HTML `<div>`. This is useful if you want to include the Webchat window in a specific section of your website.

<Note>
  If you just want to quickly add a bot to your website, use the [Quickstart guide](/webchat/get-started/quick-start). 
</Note>

<Info>
  You will need:
  - A [published bot](/get-started/quick-start)
  - Basic familiarity with HTML

  <Step title="Get your embed code">

    <GetInitScript/>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the script URL">
      Open the URL in your browser and **copy the content of the page**. It should look something like this:

      <ManualInit/>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Webchat to an HTML div">
    Now you can embed Webchat directly in an HTML `<div>` on your website:

    <EmbedInDiv/>

    <Tip>
        By default, the code above will make Webchat take up your entire screen. To change the size and position of the Webchat window, update the `bpWebchat` class.
