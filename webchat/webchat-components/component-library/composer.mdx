The `Composer` component is where the user writes messages before sending them to the bot.
It is a crucial part of the Webchat UI, providing a text area for input, optional file uploads, and integration with the chat system.

### Usage

<Note>
  Altough it can be use as a standalone component, the composer is designed to be used within the
  [Container](./container) component and alonside the [Header](./header) and [MessageList](./message-list) components.
</Note>

```tsx
import { Composer, useWebchatClient } from '@botpress/webchat'

function App() {
  const { client, clientState } = useWebchatClient({ clientId: '$CLIENT_ID$' }) // Insert your client id here

  return (
    <Composer
      disableComposer={false}
      isReadOnly={false}
      allowFileUpload={true}
      connected={clientState !== 'disconnected'}
      sendMessage={client?.sendMessage}
      uploadFile={client?.uploadFile}
      composerPlaceholder="Type a message..."
      showPoweredBy={true}
    />
  )
}
```
