The `useWebchatClient` hook provides access to the Botpress Webchat integration instance and related state.
It enables you to interact with the bot, listen to real-time events, and manage conversation lifecycle, user info, and messages.

Itâ€™s the primary entry point for integrating the Webchat experience into custom UIs or applications.

### Usage

```tsx App.tsx
import { useWebchatClient } from '@botpress/webchat'

function App() {
  const { client, clientState, on, user, conversationId, newConversation, messages, isFetchingMessages, isTyping } =
    useWebchatClient({
      clientId: '$CLIENT_ID$', // Insert your client id here
    })
}
```

### Parameters

<ResponseField name="clientId" type="string">
  Your Botpress project client ID. This is required to initialize the client and establish communication with the
  backend.
