## Quickstart

Before installing the Webchat package, make sure you have a React project set up and running.

<Note>
  Botpress Webchat currently requires React 18. Make sure your project is using
  this version to avoid compatibility issues.
</Note>

### 1. Install the package

The webchat library is hosted on npm. Download it with your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install @botpress/webchat
yarn add @botpress/webchat
pnpm add @botpress/webchat
```

### 2. Obtain your Client ID

To integrate Botpress Webchat Client into your application, you need to obtain your bot's Client ID.
This ID identifies your bot and enables communication with the Webchat service.

Follow these steps to retrieve it:

1. Select your bot in your workspace
2. Navigate to the Webchat page
3. Go to the Advanced Settings tab
4. Copy the Client ID

### 3. Basic Webchat component

Now that we have everything required, we can proceed to build a basic webchat component

```tsx App.tsx
import { Fab, Webchat } from "@botpress/webchat";
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [isWebchatOpen, setIsWebchatOpen] = useState(false);
  const toggleWebchat = () => {
    setIsWebchatOpen((prevState) => !prevState);
  };
  return (
    <>
      <Webchat
        clientId="$CLIENT_ID$" // Your client ID here
        style={{
          width: "400px",
          height: "600px",
          display: isWebchatOpen ? "flex" : "none",
          position: "fixed",
          bottom: "90px",
          right: "20px",
        }}
      ></Webchat>
      <Fab
        onClick={() => toggleWebchat()}
        style={{ position: "fixed", bottom: "20px", right: "20px" }}
      ></Fab>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Congratulations you just set your first webchat component!**
