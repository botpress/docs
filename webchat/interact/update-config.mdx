title: Update Webchat configuration
---

You can update your [Webchat's configuration](/webchat/get-started/configure-your-webchat) dynamically using JavaScript. This is useful if you want to update Webchat's style or settings after it's already loaded on your website.

<Info>
    You will need:

    - A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start)
    - Familiarity with JavaScript
</Info>

## Update configuration

To update Webchat's configuration, you can call the `window.botpress.config` method after Webchat has been initialized:

```js
window.botpress.config({ configuration: <configuration>, user: <user>});
```

## Switch to dark theme

Here's an example that updates Webchat's theme to dark mode as soon as Webchat loads:

```js
const webchatConfig = {
    "themeMode": "dark",
};

async function getBotpressUser() {
  return await window.botpress.getUser();
}

window.botpress.on('webchat:initialized', () => {
    window.botpress.config({ configuration: webchatConfig, user: getBotpressUser() });
});
```

The above snippet:

1. Waits until [Webchat is initialized](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-initalized)
2. [Gets the current Botpress user](/webchat/interact/send-user-data#on-your-website) using the `getUser` method
3. Updates the `themeMode` configuration to `dark` for the current user`

<Tip>
  You don't need to provide the entire configuration object every timeâ€”just the values that you want to update.
