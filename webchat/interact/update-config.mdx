title: Update Webchat configuration
---

You can update your [Webchat's configuration](/webchat/get-started/configure-your-webchat) dynamically using JavaScript. This is useful if you want to update Webchat's style or settings after it's already loaded on your website.

<Info>
    You will need:

    - A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start)
    - Familiarity with JavaScript
</Info>

## Update configuration

To update Webchat's configuration, you can call the [`window.botpress.config`](/webchat/interact/reference#config) method after Webchat has been initialized:

```js
window.botpress.config(
  {
    configuration: {},
  }
);
```

Include any [`configuration`](/webchat/interact/reference#param-configuration) object you'd like to apply the new configuration.

<Tip>
  You don't need to provide the entire `configuration` object every timeâ€”just the values that you want to update. Any fields you don't include will default to the most recent configuration.
</Tip>

## Switch to dark theme

Here's an example that updates Webchat's theme to dark mode as soon as Webchat loads:

```js
const webchatConfig = {
    "themeMode": "dark",
};

window.botpress.on('webchat:initialized', () => {
    window.botpress.config({ configuration: webchatConfig });
});
```

The above snippet:

1. Waits until [Webchat is initialized](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-initalized)
2. Updates the [`themeMode`](/webchat/interact/reference#param-theme-mode) configuration to `dark`
