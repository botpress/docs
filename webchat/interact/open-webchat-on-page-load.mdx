title: Automatically open Webchat on page load
---

You can automatically open Webchat when a user visits your website.

<Info>

You will need:

- A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start)
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript

</Info>

## On any visit to your website

To open Webchat every time a user visits your website, add the following script to your website's source code:

```javascript index.js
window.botpress.on('webchat:initialized', (event) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.botpress.open()
  }, 500)
})
```

This waits until [Webchat has been initialized](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-initialized), then [opens the Webchat window](/webchat/interact/open-close-webchat#open-webchat).

## On visits with a specific link

You can also use a URL hash (#) to create a custom link that opens Webchat automatically on your website. For example:

- [`botpress.com/docs`](https://botpress.com/docs): Opens the Botpress documentation
- [`botpress.com/docs#ask`](https://botpress.com/docs#ask): Opens the Botpress documentation, then opens Webchat

To create the link, add the following script to your website's source code:

```javascript index.js
window.botpress.on('webchat:initialized', (event) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.location.hash === '#ask') {
      window.botpress.open()
    }
  }, 500)

  window.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {
    if (window.location.hash === '#ask') {
      window.botpress.open()
    }
  })
})
```

This waits until [Webchat has been initialized](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-initialized), then [opens the Webchat window](/webchat/interact/open-close-webchat#open-webchat) if the URL contains the `#ask` hash. You can change the hash itself to anything you like.

## Limitation when manually initializing Webchat

If you're manually initializing Webchat, make sure you execute either of the code snippets above before you call `window.botpress.init`:

```javascript index.js
// First, execute this:
window.botpress.init({
  botId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  configuration: {
    website: {},
    email: {},
    phone: {},
    termsOfService: {},
    privacyPolicy: {},
    variant: 'soft',
    themeMode: 'light',
    fontFamily: 'inter',
  },
  clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
})

// Then, execute this:
window.botpress.on('webchat:initialized', (event) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.botpress.open()
  }, 500)
})
```

Otherwise, the event listener will miss the initialization event, and Webchat won't open.
