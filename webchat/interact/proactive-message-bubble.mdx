You can display a proactive message bubble that encourages users to open Webchat.

<Tip>
  The proactive bubble is just a Webchat UI elementâ€”it doesn't count towards any message quotas and isn't associated with any conversation.
</Tip>

<Info>
  You will need:

  - A bot that uses a toggle (either the default chat bubble or a [custom toggle](/webchat/interact/use-custom-toggle)). The proactive bubble won't work if you're [manually embedding Webchat](/webchat/get-started/embedding-webchat)
  - A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start)
</Info>

## Setup

1. From your Dashboard, go to your bot's [Webchat configuration settings.](/webchat/get-started/configure-your-webchat)
2. Under **Proactive Message Bubble**, select **Enable**.

## Configuration

After enabling the message bubble, you can configure it using the following settings:

### Proactive message

The proactive message to display to the user.

Defaults to `Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Need help?`

### Trigger type

The event that triggers the proactive bubble:

- **After Delay**: The message will appear after a fixed delay from page load
- **After User Idle**: The message will appear after a fixed delay of user inactivity

<Note>
  If the user interacts with the proactive bubble, it won't re-appear again after the same delay.
</Note>

### Delay time

The time (in seconds) before the proactive bubble appears.
