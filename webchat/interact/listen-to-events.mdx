You can listen to Webchat events within your website's source code. This is useful if you want to:

- Make your website more responsive to Webchat
- Adjust UI elements depending on Webchat's status
- Handle Webchat errors on your website

<Tip>
To listen any of the events on this page, just copy and paste the code snippet into your source code. Then, you can add whatever code you want â€” it'll execute whenever the event fires.

    - Familiarity with JavaScript
