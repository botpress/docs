You can listen to Webchat events within your website's source code. This is useful if you want to:

- Make your website more responsive to Webchat
- Adjust UI elements depending on Webchat's status
- Handle Webchat errors on your website

<Tip>
To listen any of the events on this page, just copy and paste the code snippet into your source code. Then, you can add whatever code you want—it'll execute whenever the event fires.

<Info>
    You will need:

    - A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start)
    - Familiarity with JavaScript
