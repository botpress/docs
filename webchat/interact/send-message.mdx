title: Send a message from user
---

You can programmatically send a message to your bot on the user's behalf using JavaScript.

<Info>
    You will need:

    - A website with an [embedded bot](/webchat/get-started/quick-start)
    - Familiarity with JavaScript

</Info>

## Send a message on the user's behalf

To send a message on a user's behalf, use the `sendMessage` method wrapped in an event listener:

```js
window.botpress.on('webchat:ready', () => {
  const message = "Hi there!"; // Replace with your own message
  window.botpress.sendMessage(message);
});
```

This snippet:

1. Waits until [Webchat is open and ready to receive messages](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-ready)
2. Sends the message on behalf of the user

<Note>
  The message won't send until the user has voluntarily opened the Webchat window.
</Note>

## Start the conversation on the user's behalf

To proactively open Webchat and start a conversation on the user's behalf when they visit your website:

```js
window.botpress.on('webchat:initialized', (event) => {
    window.botpress.open()
})

window.botpress.on('webchat:ready', () => {
    const message = "Hi there!"; // Replace with your own message
    window.botpress.sendMessage(message);
});
```

This snippet:

1. Waits until [Webchat is initialized](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-initialized)
2. [Opens Webchat](/webchat/interact/open-close-webchat#open-webchat)
3. Waits until [Webchat is ready to receive messages](/webchat/interact/listen-to-events#webchat-is-ready)
4. Sends the message on behalf on the user's behalf
