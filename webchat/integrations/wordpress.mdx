## From the Studio

1. Select **Share** in the upper-right corner.
2. Select **Configure**, then copy the `script` tags:

## From your Webchat settings

1. Open your bot's Workspace. In the left navigation bar, find the bot you want to embed.
2. Select **Webchat**, then open the **Share** tab.
3. Copy the **Embed code**:

# Step 2: Install the WPCode Plugin in WordPress

1. Login to your [WordPress dashboard](https://login.wordpress.org).
2. From the left navigation bar, select **Plugins**.
3. Search for the [WPCode plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/#description) and select **Install Now**.

# Step 3: Add the bot to your WordPress website

1. From the left navigation bar, select **Code Snippets**.
2. Select **Add New**. Then, select **Add Your Custom Code (New Snippet)**.
3. Select **HTML Snippet**. Then, paste your Webchat embed code into the **Code Preview** field.
4. Scroll to the **Insertion** section, then open the **Location** drop-down menu. Select **Side Wide Body**.
5. In the upper-right corner, set the snippet to **Active**, then select **Save Snippet**.
