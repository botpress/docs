The `Composer` component is where the user writes messages before sending them to the bot.
It is a crucial part of the Webchat UI, providing a text area for input, optional file uploads, and integration with the chat system:

## Usage

<Note>
  Although you can use the `Composer` as a standalone component, we recommend using it within the [Container](./container) component and alongside the [Header](./header) and [MessageList](./message-list) components.
</Note>

```tsx
import { Composer, useWebchat } from '@botpress/webchat'

function App() {
  const { client, clientState } = useWebchat({ clientId: '$CLIENT_ID$' }) // Insert your Client ID here

  return (
    <Composer
      disableComposer={false}
      isReadOnly={false}
      allowFileUpload={true}
      connected={clientState !== 'disconnected'}
      sendMessage={client?.sendMessage}
      uploadFile={client?.uploadFile}
      composerPlaceholder="Type a message..."
      showPoweredBy={true}
    />
  )
}
```

## Props

  to prevent user input temporarily, such as during a loading state or when waiting for a response from the bot.
</ResponseField>
