The `useWebchat` hook provides access to the Botpress Webchat integration instance and related state. It allows you to:
- Interact with the bot
- Listen to real-time events
- Manage conversation lifecycle, user info, and messages

`useWebchat` is the primary entry point for integrating the Webchat experience into custom UIs or applications.

## Usage

```tsx App.tsx
import { useWebchat } from '@botpress/webchat'

function App() {
  const { client, clientState, on, user, conversationId, newConversation, messages, isFetchingMessages, isTyping } =
    useWebchat({
      clientId: '$CLIENT_ID$', // Insert your Client ID here
    })
}
```
