    ## Step 1: Get your embed code

    To embed a bot on your Wix website, you need the bot's Webchat embed code. You can get the embed code from either the [Studio](/guides/studio/interface/introduction) or your [Webchat settings](/webchat/inject/getting-started).

    1. Select **Share** in the upper-right corner.
    2. Select **Configure**, then copy the `script` tags:

    1. Open your bot's Workspace. In the left navigation bar, find the bot you want to embed.
    2. Select **Webchat**, then open the **Share** tab.
    3. Copy the **Embed code**:

    ## Step 2: Add to your Wix website

    Next, add the Webchat embed code to your Wix website:

    1. Login to your [Wix](https://www.wix.com) dashboard and select **Settings** in the left navigation bar.
    2. Scroll to **Advanced Settings**, then select **Custom Code**.
    3. Select **+ Add Custom Code**. Then, paste the Webchat embed code in code snippet field.
    4. Check the **All pages** option, then select **Load code once** from the drop-down menu.

    6. Select **Apply**.

    3. Copy your **Client ID**.

    ### Get your Bot ID

    1. Open your bot's Studio.
    2. Check the page's URL. It should look something like this:
