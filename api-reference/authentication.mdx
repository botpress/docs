To authenticate with the Botpress Cloud API, you'll need to use an access token. The token types available are:

### Types of Tokens

#### 1. Personal Access Token (PAT)

A Personal Access Token (PAT) can be generated in the **Profile Settings** section of your Botpress Cloud account. Once generated, you can use this token as a Bearer token to authenticate API requests.

#### 2. Bot Token

A Bot Token is provided to the bot once it is deployed. The token is stored in the `BP_TOKEN` environment variable and can be used to authenticate API requests on behalf of the bot.

#### 3. Integration Token

An Integration Token is provided to the integration once it is deployed. Like the Bot Token, it is stored in the `BP_TOKEN` environment variable and is used to authenticate API requests for the integration.

## Authentication Methods

Once you have your token, you can authenticate your requests using one of the following methods:

### 1. Authentication with the API

To authenticate using the API, pass the `Authorization` header with the appropriate token. Here's an example of the request format:

```http
GET /api/endpoint
Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

This header should be included in all requests to the Botpress Cloud API, where `{ACCESS_TOKEN}` is replaced with the actual token you obtained (PAT, Bot Token, or Integration Token).

### 2. Authentication with the Client

You can also authenticate using the client by providing the token when creating a new client instance:

```javascript
const token = 'your-token'
const client = new Client({ token })
```

In this example:
- `token`: The access token you obtained (either PAT, Bot Token, or Integration Token).

This will create a client instance that is authenticated and can be used to interact with the API.
