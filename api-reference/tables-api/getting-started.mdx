The Tables API allows you to manage your tables, which store structured data and offer various features. You can use tables to store user data, automatically label data, and extract information from content. 

All the endpoints of the Tables API are located behind the `tables` base path (api.botpress.cloud/v1/tables/).

## Using cURL

Calling the Tables API can be done using any HTTP client, such as `curl`, `axios`, or `fetch`. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
token="$YOUR_BOTPRESS_TOKEN"
bot_id="$YOUR_BOT_ID"
# List your bot's tables
curl -H "Authorization: bearer $token" -H "x-bot-id: $bot_id" https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/tables
```

# Using the Official TypeScript Client

The official TypeScript client is available as an NPM package. You can install it using any of the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @botpress/client
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @botpress/client
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @botpress/client
```
</CodeGroup>

Once installed, you can import the client and use it in your TypeScript code:

{/* TODO(driftable): This script is subject to changes and should be auto-generated */}
```ts
import { tables } from '@botpress/client'

const main = async () => {
    const token = process.env.TOKEN
    const botId = process.env.BOT_ID

    const client = new tables.Client({
        token,
        botId,
    })

    const response = await client.listTables({})
    console.log(response.tables)
}

void main()
```
