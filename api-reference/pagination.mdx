Our APIs return paginated results. Our paging is based on a cursor-based pagination system, which means that the API returns a set of results and a cursor (`nextToken`) that you can use to retrieve the next set of results. You can use this cursor in 2 ways:

## 1. Pagination with API Query Parameters

To retrieve paginated data, you can use the `nextToken` string value returned by the previous request in your next request query parameter.

If your first API request returns the following response:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "nextToken": "wwNgQn6tWNR/IHhKGHv/sg9zcIAGsxOk0TfmM+DdmcWkBZrXYjVvcfSZIZSs4ppCr/g="
  }
}
```

The next request would look like this:

```http
GET https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/endpoint?nextToken=wwNgQn6tWNR/IHhKGHv/sg9zcIAGsxOk0TfmM+DdmcWkBZrXYjVvcfSZIZSs4ppCr/g=
```

This will return the next set of results. Repeat this process by passing the new nextToken until the response body no longer includes a `nextToken` value, indicating that there are no more results.

## 2. Pagination with the Botpress Client

### Using .collect() to Fetch Results

You can also paginate results using the `.collect()` function provided by our client utilities. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific number of items at once.

```js
const conversations = await client.list.conversations({}).collect({ limit: 1000 }); // Fetch 1000 conversations
```

The `.collect()` function will handle pagination for you automatically.

### Using Async Generator with for await

If you need to handle pagination in a more granular way, you can use an async generator with the for await syntax. This allows you to iterate over each page one by one.

```js
for await (const message of client.list.messages({ type: 'text' })) {
  console.log(message.payload.text);
}
```
