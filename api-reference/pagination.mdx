Our APIs support pagination in two primary ways, allowing you to efficiently retrieve large sets of data in smaller, manageable chunks.

## 1. Pagination with API Query Parameters

To retrieve paginated data, you can use the `nextToken` query parameter in your requests. The `nextToken` is a string that the API provides in the response meta section to indicate the next page of results.

### Request Format

```http
GET https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/endpoint?nextToken=<nextTokenValue>
```

Where:

- `nextTokenValue`: A string value provided in the `meta.nextToken` field of the last API response.

### Example

If the API returns the following response:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "nextToken": "wwNgQn6tWNR/IHhKGHv/sg9zcIAGsxOk0TfmM+DdmcWkBZrXYjVvcfSZIZSs4ppCr/g="
  }
}
```

You can use the nextToken value "abc123" to request the next page of results.

```http
GET https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/endpoint?nextToken=wwNgQn6tWNR/IHhKGHv/sg9zcIAGsxOk0TfmM+DdmcWkBZrXYjVvcfSZIZSs4ppCr/g=
```

This will return the next set of results. Repeat this process by passing the new nextToken until the response body no longer includes a nextToken value, indicating there are no more results.

## 2. Pagination with Client Utilities

### Using .collect() to Fetch Results

You can also paginate results using the .collect() function provided by our client utilities. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific number of items at once.

```js
const [latestConversation] = await client.list
  .conversations({ sortField: "createdAt", sortDirection: "desc", integrationName: "telegram" })
  .collect({ limit: 1 });
```

The .collect() function will handle pagination for you automatically.

### Using Async Generator with for await

If you need to handle pagination in a more granular way, you can use an async generator with the for await syntax. This allows you to iterate over the results one by one.

```js
for await (const message of client.list.messages({ conversationId: latestConversation.id })) {
  console.log(`### [${message.userId}]`, message.payload);
}
```
