The Runtime API is designed for bots and integrations to handle messages, events, actions, and webhook requests at runtime. Each request made to this API is authenticated as either a bot or an integration. It can also be accessed externally by providing a bot or integration Idâ€”though doing so effectively authenticates the request as a bot or integration.

All the endpoints of the Runtime API are located behind the `chat` base path (api.botpress.cloud/v1/chat/).

## Using cURL

Calling the runtime API can be done using any HTTP client, such as `curl`, `axios`, or `fetch`. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
token="$YOUR_BOTPRESS_TOKEN"
bot_id="$YOUR_BOT_ID"
# List your bot's messages
curl -H "Authorization: bearer $token" -H "x-bot-id: $bot_id" https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/chat/messages
```

# Using the Official TypeScript Client

The official TypeScript client is available as an NPM package. You can install it using any of the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @botpress/client
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @botpress/client
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @botpress/client
```
</CodeGroup>

Once installed, you can import the client and use it in your TypeScript code:

```ts
import { Client } from '@botpress/client'

const main = async () => {
    const token = process.env.BOTPRESS_TOKEN
    const botId = process.env.BOT_ID

    const client = new Client({
        token,
        botId,
    })

    const { messages } = await client.listMessages({})
    console.log(messages)
}

void main()
```
