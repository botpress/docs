import runtimeApiPayloadSize from "/snippets/api-payload-limits.mdx"

The Runtime API is designed for bots and integrations to handle messages, events, actions, and webhook requests at runtime. Each request made to this API is authenticated as either a bot or an integration. It can also be accessed externally by providing a bot or integration ID, though doing so effectively authenticates the request as a bot or integration.

All the endpoints of the Runtime API are located behind the `chat` base path (api.botpress.cloud/v1/chat/).

<Warning>
    The Runtime API has many nuances that aren't relevant to bot developers — because of this, we recommend only making your requests using the official [Botpress TypeScript Client](#using-the-official-typescript-client), which simplifies some of the API's trickier aspects.

    If you decide to interact with the Runtime API using another HTTP client, you may experience unintended behaviour or encounter issues.
</Warning>

## Using the Official TypeScript Client

The official TypeScript client is available as an NPM package. You can install it using any of the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @botpress/client
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @botpress/client
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @botpress/client
```
</CodeGroup>

Once installed, you can import the client and use it in your TypeScript code:

{/* TODO(driftable): This script is subject to changes and should be auto-generated */}
```ts
import { Client } from '@botpress/client'

const main = async () => {
    const token = process.env.TOKEN
    const botId = process.env.BOT_ID

    const client = new Client({
        token,
        botId,
    })

    const { messages } = await client.listMessages({})
    console.log(messages)
}

void main()
```

## Quotas/limits

The maximum payload size for the Runtime API is {runtimeApiPayloadSize}.

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully made your first request, you can explore other API endpoints and concepts. Here are a few things you can do next:
