Our APIs are protected using a sliding window rate limiter. This means that exceeding the allowed number of requests per time window will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` (rate-limited) response.

The rate limiter returns for each request the following headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in the current time window.
- `RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window.
- `RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window will reset in seconds.

For example, if you exceed the rate limit, you will receive the following response:

```json
{
  "type": "RateLimited",
  "description": "The request has been rate-limited.",
  "status": 429
}
```

### Example Headers

```http
RateLimit-Limit: 100
RateLimit-Remaining: 9
RateLimit-Reset: 6
```

When using the official Botpress Client, the rate limiter is automatically handled for you.
