The Admin API allows administrators to manage users, settings, and logs within the platform. This guide will help you quickly get up and running with the API.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Admin API, make sure you have the following:

- **Token**: You must generate a token to authenticate your requests. The details for obtaining and using your token are explained in our [Authorization Guide](../authorization).
- **Workspace ID**: Each API request requires the `x-workspace-id` header to specify the workspace you're operating on. Ensure you have the correct workspace ID.

All API requests will be made to endpoints under this URL.

## Two Ways to Interact with the API

There are two ways to interact with the Admin API: using **HTTP requests** or the **Botpress client**. Choose the one that fits your needs.

### 1. Using HTTP Requests

You can interact with the Admin API directly through HTTP requests. The base URL for the Admin API is:

```http
https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/admin
```

All API requests will be made to endpoints under this URL. You must include your token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. In addition to the token, you will have to include the `x-workspace-id` header in each API request. This header specifies the workspace that the request is for.

Here's an example of how to fetch a list of bots:

#### Example: Fetching bots

To fetch a list of bots, send a GET request to `/bots`. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/admin/bots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-workspace-id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"
```

This will return a JSON object containing a list of bots.

```json
{
  "bots": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "createdAt": "2025-04-03T19:25:44.810Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-04-03T19:25:44.810Z",
      "name": "string",
      "deployedAt": "2025-04-03T19:25:44.810Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "nextToken": "string"
  }
}
```

### Using the Botpress Client

Alternatively, you can use the [Botpress client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/client) to interact with the Admin API programmatically. This is ideal for integrating the Admin API within your application.

#### Installation

To install the Botpress client:

```bash
npm install @botpress/client
```

#### Example: Fetching Workspaces with the Client

After installing the client, you can instantiate it with your token and workspace ID, then use it to fetch a bot:

```js
import { Client } from "@botpress/client";

const client = new Client({
  token: "YOUR_TOKEN",
  workspaceId: "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
});

async function getBot() {
  const { bot } = await client.getBot({ id: "YOUR_BOT_ID" });
  console.log("### bot", bot);
}

getBot();
```

### Error Handling

In case of errors, the API will return an appropriate [HTTP status code and an error message](../errors). Here are some common errors you might encounter, and why:

- 401 Unauthorized: Your token and/or x-workspace-id is missing or invalid.
- 403 Forbidden: You do not have permission to perform this action.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Something went wrong on the server side.

#### Example: Handling a 401 Unauthorized Error

If you receive a 401 Unauthorized error, check that your token is valid and included in the Authorization header of your request, and that the correct x-workspace-id is provided.
