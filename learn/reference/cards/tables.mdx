You can use table Cards to perform operations on data you have stored in a table. This page contains a list of available table Cards.

<Note>
Table cards do not directly display their result. You'll need to first save the data in variables to be able to use them in the conversation.
</Note>

## Get Record

To retrieve a specific record from a table, use the **Get Record** Card. For example, you might use the Get Record operation to retrieve a user's profile information based on their unique user ID. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the **Get Record** Card to the desired Node.
2. Select the table you want to get the record from.
3. Select the **Record ID** you want to retrieve. You can either select a default ID or use variables.
4. Choose the result variable that will store the record data. (This variable needs be an [Object](/learn/reference/variables/overview#data-types-for-variables) since table records are objects.)
5. Done! You can use this variable in other Cards to access the record data.

## Insert Record

To create a new record in a table, use the **Insert Record** Card. This operation can be particularly useful when you need to store new information, such as a new user's details or a newly completed transaction. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the **Insert Record** card to the desired Node.
2. Select the table where you want to insert the record.
3. Define a value for each field. You can either define a value manually or use variables.
4. Done! Once the conversation goes through this card, the record will be created in the table.

## Update Record

To update a record in a table, use the **Update Record** Card. For example, you might use this operation to update a user's profile information or to update the status of a transaction. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the **Update Record** card to the desired Node.
2. Select the table you want to update.
3. Select the **Record ID** you want to update. You can either select a default ID or use variables. For example, if you want to update a user's profile information, you can specify their user ID as the unique identifier.
4. Select **Add properties to update**, then select the columns you want to change. For each column, you can define a value manually or use variables.
5. Done! Once the conversation goes through this card, the record will be updated in the table.

## Delete Record

To delete a record in a table, use the **Delete Record** Card. For example, you might use this operation to delete a user's data if they choose to deactivate their account. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the `Delete Record` card to the desired Node.
2. Select the table where you want to delete the record.
3. Select the ID of the record you want to delete. You can either select a default ID or use variables.
4. Done! Once the conversation goes through this card, the record will be deleted from the table.

<Warning>
Deleted records cannot be recoveredâ€”make sure you're deleting the correct record.
</Warning>

## Find Records

To search for and fetch multiple records, use the **Find Records** Card. For example, you might use this operation to fetch all transactions made by a specific user. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the **Find Records** Card to the desired Node.
2. Select the table where you want to find records.
3. Define your filter criteria in natural language. You can also use variables to make this query dynamic like: `Price is below ${workflow.maxPrice}`.
4. Choose the result variable that will store the data. (This variable needs to have the [Array](/learn/reference/variables/overview#data-types-for-variables) type)
5. Done! You can use this variable in subsequent Cards to access the data.
