You can use the Set Inactivity Timeout Card to **override the default inactivity timeout** configured in your [Bot Settings](/learn/reference/bot-settings#inactivity-timeout).

<Tip>
  This Card won't work in the Studio's Emulator. Instead, you can test it using the [shareable Webchat link](/learn/get-started/quick-start#preview-and-share-your-bot).
</Tip>

## Configuration

<Note>
  This Card is only available for [Standard Nodes](/learn/reference/nodes/introduction).
</Note>

To use the Card, just [add it to any Node in your Workflow](/learn/reference/cards/introduction#add-a-card). The new inactivity timeout will apply starting from when the Card executes.

It has the following settings:

  - **Conversation ID**: The ID of the conversation to update. Defaults to [`event.conversationId`](/learn/guides/advanced/event-properties#param-conversation-id) (current conversation)
  - **Timeout**: The duration of the timeout in minutes. Set to `0` for the conversation to never expire, or to `-1` to reset to the default timeout
