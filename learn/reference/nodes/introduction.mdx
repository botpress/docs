Nodes are the **primary units of conversational logic** in your bot.

Think of a Node as a single step in a conversation. It executes a sequence of actions — like sending a message, capturing information from a user, or performing a task — then transitions to the next Node.

## Overview

An individual Node's behaviour depends on what [Cards](/learn/reference/cards/introduction) it contains. You can add any combination of Cards to a Node to achieve your desired behaviour.

A Node [transitions to the next Node](#transition-to-from-a-node) when either:

- It finishes executing all its Cards
- One of its Cards manually transitions to a new Node. You can set up manual transitions based on [user choice](/learn/reference/cards/capture-information), [true/false conditions](/learn/reference/cards/flow-logic), and more.

<Note>
  Some Nodes have specific properties that make them behave differently — check out [Types of Node](#types-of-node) for
  more details.

<Tip>
  A group of Nodes is called a [Workflow](/learn/reference/workflows). You can use Workflows to organize your bot's
  behaviour.

## Usage

### Add a Node

To add a new Node:

1. Right-click anywhere in a Workflow.
2. Select a type of Node from the popup menu.

### Transition to/from a Node

To create a transition to/from a Node:

1. Select and hold one of the Node's edges and drag outwards.
2. Release on another Node's edge. This will create a transition between the two Nodes.

Any transitions to a Node's left edge determine transitions _to_ that Node, while transitions from its right edge determine transitions _from_ that Node:

## Types of Node

### Standard Node

The Standard node is a versatile building block in your bot's workflow. It allows you to add both instructions and transitions to your flow, and it can be used to represent a variety of steps in the conversation with the user.

You can add instructions to the Standard node to define what the bot should do at that point in the conversation, such as sending a message or asking the user for input. You can also add transitions to the Standard node to specify the conditions under which the conversation should proceed to the next node.

Standard nodes can be connected to other nodes within the same workflow using transitions, allowing you to create complex conversation flows that adapt to the user's input and actions. They are essential building blocks for creating conversational AI experiences that are engaging and useful for your users.

### Autonomous Node

The Autonomous node uses an LLM to determine when, and in what order, to execute the cards it contains. Based on the context of the conversation, as well as a set of instructions provided by the builder, Autonomous nodes manage conversation flows and decide what actions to perform.

Autonomous Nodes can be created by right-clicking in the studio and selecting "Autonomous Node" from the dropdown menu.

### Start Node

The Start Node is a specialized Entry Node that is only available in the main flow of a Botpress bot. It serves as the starting point for the conversation and can only execute transitions to other standard nodes.

### Entry Node

Every workflow in your bot, except the main flow, starts with an Entry node. The Entry node is the starting point for each individual workflow and can only execute transitions to other standard nodes within that workflow. It is used to define the entry point for the workflow and the initial conditions that must be met for the workflow to start executing.

### Exit Node

Similar to the Entry node, every workflow in your bot, except the main flow, should end with an Exit node. The Exit node is the final node in a workflow and can only receive transitions from other standard nodes within that workflow. It is used to define the exit point for the workflow and specify the conditions that must be met for the workflow to end. The Exit node typically contains cleanup or finalization logic, such as sending a message to the user or updating a database, before the workflow is completed.

### End Node

The End Node is a unique node in your bot's Main Flow. Its purpose is to clear the conversation session and reset the bot to its initial state once it is reached. When the End Node is executed, it will erase all variables and user data associated with the conversation and set the cursor back to the beginning of the Main Flow.

The End Node is typically used when you want to reset the conversation with the user and start a new session from scratch. It is particularly useful for bots that handle sensitive or personal information, where it is important to ensure that previous session data is not accessible to subsequent users.

Note that the End Node is only available in the Main Flow of your bot and cannot be used in other workflows.
