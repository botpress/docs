Hooks **execute custom JavaScript code** at specific cycles of your bot's operation. For example:

- [Before each outgoing message](#before-outgoing)
- [After each LLMz iteration](#after-llmz-iteration)
- [At the end of each conversation](#after-conversation-end)

You can use Hooks to intercept and modify messages, perform logging, integrate with external systems, and more.

<Tip>
### Hooks vs. Actions / Execute Code

Hooks let you use custom code with your bot, just like [Actions](/learn/reference/actions) and [Execute Code Cards](/learn/reference/cards/execute). The key difference is when the code runs:
    - Actions and Execute Code Cards run at some point in your [Workflow](/learn/reference/workflows).
    - Hooks run during specific stages of the bot’s operation cycle
</Tip>

## Overview

When you add a new Hook, it defines a [function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) that executes every time your bot reaches a certain cycle of its operation.

All Hooks take an `event` parameter, which contains information about the event that triggered the Hook.

<Note>
    Some Hook types take additional parameters — check out the Hook guides on this page for more information.
</Note>

### Add a Hook

1. Navigate to the <Icon icon="anchor"/> Hooks section in the Studio's left navigation bar.
2. Select **Create Hook**, then choose a type for the Hook.
3. Choose a name for the Hook. Done!

## Hook types

Here's a breakdown of each type of Hook:

### Before Incoming

This Hook type executes its code before your bot processes an incoming `event`.

**Parameters**:

<ResponseField
    name="event"
    type="IO.IncomingEvent"
>
    The message received by the bot.
</ResponseField>

### After Incoming

This Hook type executes its code after the incoming message has been processed, but before the bot has responded..

**Parameters**:

<ResponseField
    name="event"
    type="IO.IncomingEvent"
>
    The message received by the bot.
</ResponseField>

### Before Outgoing

This Hook type executes its code before the bot's reply is sent to the user.

**Parameters**:

<ResponseField
    name="event"
    type="IO.IncomingEvent"
>
    The message received by the bot
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField
    name="outgoingEvent"
    type="IO.OutgoingEvent"
>
    The message sent by the bot
</ResponseField>

### Before LLMz Execution

This Hook type executes its code before the LLMz engine begins its execution.

<ResponseField
    name="event"
    type="IO.IncomingEvent"
>
    The message received by the bot
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField

### After LLMz iteration

Depending on how demanding the task is, the LLMz may loop through multiple iterations before finishing its execution. This Hook type executes its code after each iteration.

**Parameters**:

**Parameters**:

<ResponseField
    name="event"
    type="IO.IncomingEvent"
>
    The message received by the bot
</ResponseField>

### After Turn End

This Hook type executes after a full turn has completed — meaning the bot has received user input, processed it, and responded.

You can use a Hook of this type to track AI spend and token cost for your bot.

## Troubleshooting

If your Hook isn't behaving as expected, you can [check your bot's logs](/learn/reference/debugger-logs-json) to diagnose any problems.
