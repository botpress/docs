In the Chatbot Settings menu, accessible through the left-hand menu of the Studio, you can adjust general settings that apply to your bot's flows and functions.

# Inactivity Timeout

This is the amount of time, in minutes, that your bot will wait for a response before ending the session. When the session ends, your bot will automatically trigger the Timeout flow.

When the Timeout is triggered, your user's position in the workflow along with any workflow variables are cleared.

You can set this to '0' to prevent the bot from ever timing out.

The maximum value is 1440 minutes, or 24 hours.

# Node Repetition Limit

This is the maximum amount of times a conversation can go through any specific node. When the user reaches this node repetition limit, an error will be triggered.

The maximum value is 10.

# Use the Botpress Client

This option allows the 'client' object to be used in the code editor to access to Botpress client.

# Default LLMs

In these sections, you identify which Large Language Model (LLM) you'd like to use for various purposes. These are generally identified as Fast, Best, or per-use through individual cards.

## Fast

This model should be used for quick and easy tasks, prioritizing speed and cost over performance.

## Best

This model should be used for complex tasks, prioritizing performance over speed or cost.

## Autonomous Language Model

This is the model that powers LLMz and generates responses, including all of your Autonomous Nodes.

# LLMz Version

The version of LLMz that your bot uses. We recommend staying updated to the latest version, but you may find that a bot built on previous versions of LLMz function best on those versions.

# Variables

In these sections, you can identify [variables](/learn/reference/variables) that exist above the scope of workflow variables, like user and bot variables.
