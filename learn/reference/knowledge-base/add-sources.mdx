You can add sources to a Knowledge Base—your bot will reference them when searching for an answer to a user's question.

## Websites

To add a website to your Knowledge Base, select **Website** in its menu. Here's a breakdown of the options for adding websites:

### From a website's root domain

By default, you can add a root domain (or some subpath of a root domain) and let Botpress discover the other pages on that website.

For example, if you enter `botpress.com`, Botpress will discoverer all the subpaths of that domain, like:

- `botpress.com/docs`
- `botpress.com/features/knowledge-bases`
- `botpress.com/industries/ecommerce`

and more. Then, you can select which pages to add to your Knowledge Base.

### From specific pages

If you want to add specific web pages without discovering any subpaths, open the drop-down menu and select **Specific Web Pages**. Then, enter the exact address of the page you want to add.

For example, if you enter `botpress.com/blog`. you'll add that exact page only—none of its subpaths will be included.

### Re-crawling

By default, Botpress indexes any web pages you add once, then continues to reference that version of the pages. However, you can also schedule a re-crawling of the pages:

1. After adding web pages to your Knowledge Base, select them from your list of knowledge sources.
2. Open the **Recrawl** drop-down menu.
3. Select one of the other re-crawling schedules—like **Recrawl Daily**.

Re-crawling is useful for keeping your bot up to date on changes to your website. For example, the Botpress documentation's
<a onClick={() => window.botpress.open()}>AI assistant</a>
re-crawls `botpress.com/docs` every day to stay up-to-date when new documentation is added.
{/* vale on */}

## Documents

You can upload documents and files to your Knowledge Base—just select the **Documents** option from its menu. Here's a list of supported file formats:

- `.pdf`
- `.html`
- `.txt`
- `.doc`
- `.docx`
- `.md`

<Note>
Documents can be up to 50 MB each.
</Note>

### From API

Knowledge Bases use the Botpress [Files API](/api-reference/files-api/getting-started) to manage documents. This means you can programmatically upload documents to a Knowledge Base:

1. Select the **API** option from your Knowledge Base's menu.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Tables

If you use [tables](/learn/reference/tables) to store data, you can connect them to a Knowledge Base.

1. Open the Knowledge Base.
2. Select the **Table** option.
3. Select any tables you'd like to add.

After adding a table to your Knowledge Base, users can ask natural-language questions about the data in your tables—this is useful for inventory data, pricing charts, and other types of structured data.

## Search the web

You can give your bot the ability to search the web independently for answers to user questions—just select **Web Search** from your Knowledge Base's menu.

While [adding websites](#add-websites) indexes data from specific web pages for your bot to reference, the **Web Search** searches the internet in real time to find an answer to the user's prompt.

By default, this option gives your bot access to search the entire web. However, you can also filter the results:

### Filter by website

You can filter which websites your bot searches on. Under **On which websites should we search on**, open the drop-down menu :

- **Search on specific websites**: Useful for scoping responses to specific sources, like a company website.
- **Search the entire web**: Useful when your bot needs access to a broader set of information to answer user questions.
- **The entire web, except these websites**: Useful for filtering out unreliable sources or competitors' websites

### Filter by time period

You can filter search results by time period. Under **Filter search results by time period**, open the drop-down menu:

- **Don't filter based on time**
- **Pages discovered in the last 24 hours**
- **Pages discovered in the last 7 days**
- **Pages discovered in the last 30 days**

When you select one of these options, it'll only include pages that Botpress indexed or discovered in the specified range.

## Rich text

You can add rich text directly into a Knowledge Base.

1. Open the Knowledge Base.
2. Select the **Rich Text** option.

By default, this adds an empty rich text document—you can then open and edit its contents.

### Filter by column

By default, all your table's columns are available in the Knowledge Base. If you want to filter results to only specific columns, select the table and uncheck any columns you want to exclude.

<Note>
  If your table is displaying **No searchable columns**, make sure your table has at least one column [marked as searchable](/learn/reference/tables#making-fields-searchable).
</Note>

You can connect your tables of data to a Knowledge Base, allowing users to directly search for information. This can be especially invaluable for vast datasets, as it provides a straightforward and user-friendly method to retrieve data.

## Sources from integrations

You can add content from certain [integrations](/integrations/get-started/introduction) to your Knowledge Base. If you install an integration that's compatible with Knowledge Bases, that integration will either:

- Be displayed alongside the other options in your Knowledge Base (like the [Notion](https://botpress.com/integrations/notion) integration)
- Have [Cards](/learn/reference/cards/introduction) that handle synchronization with Knowledge Bases (like the [Google Drive](https://botpress.com/integrations/googledrive) integration)
