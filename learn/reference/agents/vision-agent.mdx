The Vision Agent adds image recognition and visual processing capabilities to the bot. It allows the bot to analyze and interpret visual data, such as images, screenshots, or camera feeds.

<Info>
    To use the Vision Agent, you need to:
    
    - Add the **Extract Content from Image** Card to your Autonomous Node
    - Enable **Extract from Incoming Images** in your [Autonomous Node's configuration](/learn/reference/nodes/autonomous-node#configuration)
</Info>

## Configuration

### Extract from Incoming Images

When this option is enabled, the bot will attempt to extract any text content from an image. It will also produce a description of the image itself.

The Vision Agent will save any extracted content and descriptions to the variable it exposes.

### Exposed Variables

The Vision Agent exposes one variable for use:

```
{{turn.Visionagent.content}}
```
