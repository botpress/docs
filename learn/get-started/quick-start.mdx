## Step 1: Build your bot


1. [Sign up for Botpress](https://sso.botpress.cloud/login).
2. Select either **Start building** or **Build my agent**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure your first bot. We'll take care of everything for you, and your AI agent will be ready to test and deploy within minutes.

<Note>
  If you'd prefer to set your bot up from scratch, hit **Skip** and head over to the [tutorial](/tutorial/introduction)—we'll show you how to start building with Botpress Studio.
</Note>

## Step 2: Fine-tune your bot (Optional)

After completing the setup process, we'll show you a preview of your bot, trained on your sources and styled to match to your brand. Try chatting with your bot—you may want to keep it as-is!

If you need to fine-tune anything, check out the resources below:

### Appearance and style

The preview we show you is built using [Webchat](/webchat/get-started/introduction), Botpress' custom front-end. If you want to customize your bot's appearance and style, you can configure its Webchat settings:

<Card

  icon="paintbrush"

  href="/webchat/get-started/configure-your-webchat"
>
  Configure and style your bot
</Card>

### Behaviour

After completing the setup process, you might realize you need to fine-tune your bot's behaviour. Maybe you forgot to provide a certain knowledge source, or want to tweak its instructions.

You can do this with [Botpress Studio](/learn/reference/introduction), our agent-building platform. Check out Studio concepts to learn more about them, or start from scratch with the tutorial:

    icon="message-square"
    href="/webchat/get-started/introduction"

    Use Webchat to embed your bot on your website
  </Card>
