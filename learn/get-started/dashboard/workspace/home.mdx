## Recent

A dashboard that shows recently active and edited bots in your Workspace, along with a real-time overview of analytics and bot activity.

## Bots

Lists all of the bots in your Workspace. At a glance you can see the bot's name, how many integrations it has installed, any runtime errors, whether it has enabled Always Alive status, and view more information about the bot or edit it directly in the Studio.

## View as

This menu allows you to preview your Workspace profile as a member of the public, or a member of the Workspace itself. You can use this to gauge how other builders will see your Workspace when you contribute an integration or Workflow.

## Usages

Shows relevant usage metrics, sorted by consumption. You can use this to get a quick overview of which usage limits are closest to reaching their cap.

## Recent changes

A log of the most recent changes and updates made to bots in the given Workspace, sorted by the time of the change.

## Hub contributions

The most recent contributions this Workspace has made to the Botpress Hub.

## Members
