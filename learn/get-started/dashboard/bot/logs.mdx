Botpress production logs are detailed records of the activities, events, and errors that occur during the execution of a Botpress bot in a production environment. These logs are essential for monitoring your bot's performance, diagnosing issues, and maintaining the overall health of your bot project.

You can filter logs by date and time to narrow down your search for a specific event or conversation.

# Custom logging

The `console.log()` function is used to log information to the Botpress logs.

To add logging to your bot, follow these steps:

* In a new or existing Execute Code card, add the following code:

```typescript
console.log("Some text");
```

* Replace the text with the information you wish to log, or the statement you'd like to print to the console.

Once you've saved and published your changes, your bot will print that statement to its logs every time the Execute Code card is triggered as part of a Workflow.

You can customize this message to include any information that you need to log, such as user input or API responses.
