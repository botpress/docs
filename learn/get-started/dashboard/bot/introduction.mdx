In Botpress, a bot is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to interact with users through various messaging platforms, automate tasks, and provide information based on predefined flows, content, and integrations. A bot can handle tasks such as answering questions, processing requests, and executing complex workflows, making it a key component of forward-thinking digital experience, customer support, and IT teams, among many others.

## Chatbot vs. AI Agent

On Botpress, you build bots. This is the name given to the defined piece of software you create in the Studio or through the API and deploy to the channel(s) of your choice.

A bot can be a chatbot, an AI agent, or a combination of the two. Here's a quick rundown of the differences between these semantic categories.

### Chatbot

A bot is a software application designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically through text or voice interactions. It follows predefined scripts, rules, and flows to provide responses based on user inputs. Chatbots are often used for tasks like answering FAQs, guiding users through processes, or providing basic customer support.

### AI Agent

An AI agent is a more advanced software application that uses artificial intelligence to make decisions, learn from interactions, and take actions autonomously. Unlike a traditional chatbot, an AI agent can analyze data, understand context, and adapt its behavior based on previous interactions or external factors. AI agents can handle more complex tasks, including problem-solving, decision-making, and predictive analytics.

The choice is yours!

Botpress allows you to build chatbots, AI agents, or combine the two depending on what task you're looking to accomplish.

You can combine the predictable, rule-based logic of traditional chatbots with the flexible autonomy of LLM-driven AI agents to customize a bot to your specific need.
