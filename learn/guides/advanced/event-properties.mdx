Whenever an event occurs during your bot's execution—like a message being sent—you can access details about that event using the `event` object's properties.

The `event` object is available [wherever you can use code in Botpress Studio](/learn/guides/advanced/use-code). This includes:

- [Hooks](/learn/reference/hooks)
- [Actions](/learn/reference/actions)
- [Execute Code Cards](/learn/reference/cards/execute-code)

You can also access the `event` object within certain [Cards](/learn/reference/cards/introduction)' configuration fields.

<Warning>
    This documentation omits certain properties of the `event` object which exist to maintain internal functionality and aren't useful for <Tooltip tip="Happy bot building!">bot builders</Tooltip>.
