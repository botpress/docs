title: Using code in Studio
---

You can **write custom code to interact with your bot programatically** in many areas of Botpress Studio.

<Tip>
    Wherever you write custom code in Studio, you can access the [event object's properties](/learn/guides/advanced/event-properties) to get information about the last event in your bot's operation.
</Tip> 

## Language

You can use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) or regular [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for custom code.

## Where you can use code

Depending on your needs, you have a few options on where to write code in Studio. Here's a cheat sheet:

    | Option             	| Executes                                                                	| Reusable 	| Example                                                                       	|
| -------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| [Actions](/learn/reference/actions)            	| When an [Autonomous Node](/learn/reference/nodes/autonomous-node) decides to (based on the conversation's context) 	| ✅        	| Make an API call to a weather service whenever the user asks for the weather  	|
| [Execute Code Cards](/learn/reference/cards/execute-code) 	| At a specific point in a [Workflow](/learn/reference/workflows)                                        	| ❌        	| Perform a one-time operation on some data provided by a user                  	|
| [Hooks](/learn/reference/hooks)              	| At a specific stage of the bot's operation                               	| ✅        	| Every time a bot responds, add the total AI spend for its response to a table 	|

Check out each section below for a more detailed breakdown:

### Actions

[Actions](/learn/reference/actions) are reusable code snippets that only [Autonomous Nodes](/learn/reference/nodes/autonomous-node) can use.

Use Actions when:

- You need to execute a piece of code more than once
- You want AI to decide when to execute your code

### Execute Code Cards

[Execute Code Cards](/learn/reference/cards/execute-code) execute a one-time piece of code at some point in a [Workflow](/learn/reference/workflows). They're not reusable and can't be added to an Autonomous Node.

Use Execute Code Cards when:

- You only need to execute a piece of code in one place
- You want complete control over when the code executes

### Hooks

[Hooks](/learn/reference/hooks) execute code at specific stages of your bot's operation, like before every user message or after every conversation ends. They operate separately from your bot's conversational logic — when you create a Hook, it always executes at the same stage, no matter what changes you make to your Workflow.

Use Hooks when:

- You need to execute a piece of code every time your bot reaches a certain stage of its operation
- You need access to information about the Autonomous Node's iteration or the current turn's metadata

## Libraries

The following libraries come pre-installed in the Studio's code editor:

| Name | Description | Usage |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) | HTTP client for making API requests. | Available globally as `axios` |
| [lodash](https://lodash.com) | Utility library for data manipulation. | Available globally as `_` |
| [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) | Library for date/time manipulation. | Available globally as `luxon` |
| [botpress/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/client) | Official Botpress HTTP client to query the [Botpress API](/api-reference/introduction). | Available globally as `client` |
| [bpinternal/zui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bpinternal/zui) | A fork of [Zod](https://zod.dev) with additional features. | Available globally as `z` / `zui` |
| [botpress/zai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/zai) | Botpress utility library that uses AI to manipulate and generate Zui schemas and objects. | Available globally as `zai` |

<Warning>
    You can't import external libraries into the Studio's code editor.
