We believe the best way to learn Botpress is to **start using it**. Once you've finished the [Quickstart guide](/learn/get-started/quick-start) and deployed your first bot, follow the how-to guides in this section and start building.

<Tip>
Visual learner? You can find helpful video guides on the [Botpress YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Botpress). Whenever a page in this section has a corresponding video guide, we'll link to it.

You can also check out the [Botpress Academy](https://botpress.com/academy) for crash courses on [pricing](https://botpress.com/academy-course/pricing), [navigating the UI](https://botpress.com/academy-course/ui-guide-studio), and more.

## Learn by doing

Botpress is a powerful, customizable platform — this means no one user will have exactly the same needs when building a bot.

Our how-to guides are great for learning common use-cases and troubleshooting issues. However, **they might not walk you through every step of your own process** — and that's okay! We want to help you build confidence to experiment, so you can build bots that behave exactly how you want.
