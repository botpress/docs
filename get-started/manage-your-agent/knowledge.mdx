title: Add knowledge sources
---

You can add and manage knowledge sources in the **<Icon icon="book-open-text"/> Knowledge** section of your agent's menu. Here's a breakdown of each sub-section:

## Tables

You can view data your agent has stored in the **Tables** sub-section. Select any table to view its contents.

<Note>
  You can [create new tables in Studio](/studio/concepts/tables) if you want your agent to store custom data.
</Note>

---

## Knowledge Bases

You can manage which sources your bot has access to in the **Knowledge Bases** sub-section.

Every new agent has a default empty Knowledge Base. Open it, then select **+ Add Knowledge Source** to provide your agent with new sources—it'll automatically reference them when answering users.

<Tip>
  You can also select **+ Add Knowledge Base** to create an entirely new Knowledge Base.
</Tip>

### Configure in Studio

If you need more control over your Knowledge Bases, you can [configure them in Studio](/studio/concepts/knowledge-base/introduction). This gives you access to advanced options for each [type of source](/studio/concepts/knowledge-base/add-sources).

### Storage

When you add and use knowledge sources, it counts towards your File Storage and Vector DB Storage. You can see an overview of your current usage at the top of the section.

If you need additional storage, select **Add Storage**. Check out our [pricing page](https://botpress.com/pricing) for more details.
