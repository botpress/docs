---

If you want to allow a live agent to join your agent's conversations, you can configure this in the **<Icon icon="message-square-reply"/> Human Handoff** section of your bot's menu.

## Setup

To get started using Human Handoff, you need to install the official integration:

<Card title="Configure Human Handoff " icon="plug" horizontal>
  Install and configure the official integration <Tooltip tip="This feature requires a Botpress Plus plan or higher."><Badge stroke color="blue">Plus</Badge></Tooltip>
</Card>

When you've finished setting up the integration, you'll have access to the Human Handoff dashboard.
