By the end of this guide, you'll have a bot that:

- Uses AI to respond to messages
- Aligns with your branding
- Has a unique, shareable link

## Step 1: Build your bot

<Steps>
  <Step>[Sign up for Botpress](https://sso.botpress.cloud/login).</Step>
  <Step>Select either **Start building** or **Build my agent**.</Step>
  <Step>
    Choose how you want to build your agent:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Using a visual, drag-and-drop canvas (Studio)">
        If you want to build your bot using a visual, drag-and-drop interface, select [Botpress Studio](/studio/introduction).

        Follow the on-screen instructions to configure your first bot. We'll take care of the initial setup for you, and your AI agent will be ready to test and deploy within minutes.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Using code (ADK)">
        If you want to build an agent in TypeScript with full control, select [Agent Development Kit](/for-developers/adk/overview).

        Follow the on-screen instructions to set up an agent on your local machine and deploy it within minutes.

    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you'd prefer to set your bot up from scratch, hit **Skip** and head over to the [tutorial](/tutorial/introduction)—we'll show you how to start building with Botpress Studio.
</Note>

## Step 2: Fine-tune your bot (Optional)

After completing the setup process, we'll show you a preview of your bot, trained on your sources and styled to match to your brand. Try chatting with your bot—you may want to keep it as-is!

If you need to fine-tune anything, check out the resources below:

### Appearance and style

The preview we show you is built using [Webchat](/webchat/get-started/introduction), Botpress' custom front-end. If you want to customize your bot's appearance and style, you can configure its Webchat settings:

<Card
  title="Edit appearance"
  icon="paintbrush"
  horizontal
  href="/webchat/get-started/configure-your-webchat"
>
  Configure and style your bot
</Card>

### Behaviour

After completing the setup process, you might realize you need to fine-tune your bot's behaviour. Maybe you forgot to provide a certain knowledge source, or want to tweak its instructions.

You can do this with [Botpress Studio](/studio/introduction), our agent-building platform. Check out Studio concepts to learn more about them, or start from scratch with the tutorial:

## Step 3: Deploy your bot

When you're ready to deploy your bot, select one of the options below:

<CardGroup>
  <Card
    title="Add to your website"
    icon="message-square"
    href="/webchat/get-started/introduction"
  >
    Use Webchat to embed your bot on your website
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Integrate with a channel"
    icon="plug"
    href="/integrations/get-started/introduction"
  >
    Integrate your bot with another channel or external service
  </Card>
